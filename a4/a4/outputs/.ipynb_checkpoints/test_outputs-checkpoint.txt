You know what I do is write for kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, plus read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with leather leather and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you today about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is generally something that fell somewhere away.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of a complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed every week in the boys' bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life for letting me enter the bathroom of the teachers.
I did it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years <unk> I felt the need to start working on organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at the middle of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we have never come to know us.
You could go to Ohio -- and please bring that man who I know you've seen.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I would like you to stand with it, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We find it a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because it was.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of <unk> and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had gone closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it became present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy today I talked a lot about this.
It needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water about 60 feet -- and I couldn't think that it was a <unk> of snow on another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when you get the glaciers in the glaciers or break the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and they hold onto the end, whereas others can't afford it more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and separated by ourselves, as much as we see ourselves as humans.
But reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> <unk> I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As a iceberg the <unk> releases fresh water in minerals that feed many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was just the portraits of my ancestors, so knowing that these unique moments exist in that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the life cycle.
Part of the ice in the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's little frequent to get to witness a <unk> <unk>
Here they are.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and your line line.
You can see here, you start <unk> the boat has moved towards the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg in average size.
<unk> about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want two couples to 1979, the same day, exactly at the same moment, every single <unk> a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to move too much on the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception. I won't pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm comes together to the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome of the sperm comes together to the X X <unk>
They both <unk> and it starts alive.
We'll go back to them later.
In my <unk> I will fulfill two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered <unk> <unk> the idea of <unk> which have thought about the body.
The other role in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients, or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features challenge social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins <unk> two people inside a single body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical node doesn't fit into the male <unk> and conventional <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> lots of shapes.
I'm going to give you a few examples in ways of having sex that doesn't fall into the common forms or a <unk>
For example, there is the case of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in life <unk> which becomes <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testes produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks <unk> of testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a result, the body develops in a <unk> course of a <unk>
When you <unk> the baby has a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl, she's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast but do not have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
After giving you examinations you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think of a man, but it's not really like that.
Women like men, we have in the body -- something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know his <unk> structure, I think to be a typical woman most of the women who are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with the <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome.
That's why sex is complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way, they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19-year-old boy who was born and raised as a <unk> I had girlfriend, and sexual ties with her, he had a life as a kid and just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had <unk> chromosomes and the uterus <unk> <unk> were so active that, in essence, creating a male <unk> environment.
As a result, its genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was women inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th brain chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is they have tissue <unk> wrapped up.
We don't know why that happens.
So there's a lot of varieties of sex.
The reason why kids with this kind of bodies are going to be <unk> twins <unk> or <unk> <unk> to <unk> surgery is not to be able to have a better physical health <unk>
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
And the reason why it's <unk> several surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is a <unk> identity, <unk> being black means to have an African anatomy in historical terms.
Very simplistic idea.
And when it presents us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture to <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very Romantic <unk>
Imagine how surprising it is to have children that are born as two people within a same body.
The highest case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sex at the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called to wonder: "What do you do to figure out if you <unk> <unk> or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there isn't such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or <unk> and women and <unk> are we who map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we get to science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- to we thought of them were a stable <unk> categories that are <unk> directly with <unk> categories, are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
In terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you <unk> from them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science we get more and more in a <unk> area where we have to acknowledge that the categories of <unk> which are probably too much <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to put a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of your nose, and if you didn't get it <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma of really determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this <unk> explosion could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a liberal, <unk> people with unusual bodies -- but I have to admit to me that makes me nervous.
You know, that these categories are much more fragile than we thought to me.
It is from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so <unk> in what they did, that I find myself so much looking at that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with <unk>
Parents <unk> -- and for me, the first activists of anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you all remember, what our parents were.
And the monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were the idea that the political power came to the law of blood passed the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents had rejected that idea, and we were replacing it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences. That was a really radical thing.
And partly they were doing it because they're part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And there's very clear if you look at the story of the Founding <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power <unk> passed on a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and God of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And a result, we were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And by doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think of it that way, but it was great.
And what happened years next?
And women <unk>
Then he came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men at the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people are going to go to <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves, why we keep certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights than a human.
I don't want to say that we should blame anatomy.
I don't mean that the age of five years should be allowed to have sexual relationships or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they are, and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term: <unk> on March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary will be attributed to all the rights three months before Henry <unk> the right to the vote, the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born.
We find other <unk> relative to their rights.
Henry, at virtue of being considered a man -- if I didn't tell you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of the Mary that Mary doesn't have to worry.
<unk> on his part, does not have the same rights for marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can be married in all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories, which in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science moved so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy might be <unk>
I don't want to give up science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided to marry a man -- you don't have to have chromosome and to marry a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't make tests by <unk> to people.
But this is also very strange to given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I would love to <unk> a solution.
It says that we should be judge people who are <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems <unk>
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure we should be able to <unk> this to <unk> people because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions and smart <unk> about their sexual relationships that people from 40 than I know.
So how do you put the issue of the <unk> content.
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI <unk>
We want to really get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job for democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live -- for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels like a man who feels like a man who feels <unk> unless it's willing to be killed, unless they are willing to be willing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon with which I talked about a couple of years ago I had done to light twins <unk> and then pick them up and put her name.
But when the phone, I asked her the <unk> of the operation, it was very <unk> he told me that in that other country, these children would be very <unk> and so he had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum.
The United States offers tremendous possibilities for people to be who are not <unk> to change the good state of the state.
So I think we need to be on your head.
Well, to finish up, I mean I've been talking about the <unk>
And I want to think about what the democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we were given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a <unk> and is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in looking at the sex difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in college, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what has the female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking gender, of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about her question, more than there is a female thing in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male who makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the parents were really excited to find out how to protect the people around the state, it's possible that they can have put more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond <unk> think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> out of apartments.
Imagine that half of those who would like to live in apartments were already owners, and that the other half is still not <unk>
You could try to increase the ability to increase the ability to make <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the building causes of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new place to build a whole new apartments building completely new, and when the rules of that <unk> place to build <unk>
So I proposed that governments would use new zones of reform big enough to hold cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of political <unk>
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> went through a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next elections, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which they <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk on TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of testing with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like <unk> and usually the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are much more valuable than its <unk> cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City <unk> land that in some cases, is worth thousands per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, which a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called me up and told me that we had to do this project, this might be important, this could be the way our country <unk>
He asked me to go to <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was about explaining that to make a lot of value for a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 kilometers of square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> that a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could go that could be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help of <unk> countries could benefit from the countries that they could benefit from the countries that help them to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily <unk> about 1,000 square miles.
And soon after, the 19th of January, voted in Congress to <unk> the Constitution and add a constitutional solution that would allow you to create these special <unk> regions.
In a country that was just going through this <unk> crisis voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of those are all different in society, the <unk>
To <unk> the Constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
February 17 was passed over again in another voting <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting dictionary, the 21st of February, a <unk> <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world that are most interested in building in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new large center of the city that is building in Korea, it's bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after it spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, you've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are making a legal system that would allow the <unk> and maybe it would allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the court ultimately for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that want to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go there.
In the world there are 700 million people who tell them that they would like to change immediately elsewhere.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go and get a job -- sometimes they're the single mothers who have to earn money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all around the world?
What does it look like to do in insisting for families to choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you."
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is -- I'm going to make a confession public and is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, photograph and publish my <unk> and colorful <unk> and different people for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is <unk> of <unk> markets, and the second hand.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores let me reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying my search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be my size?
<unk>
It cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I have won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you have all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what that suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
<unk> interior for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And since I don't know about the woman who walks for TED in underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you the data for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons that I think I believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new <unk>
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see well.
You can almost always see it for less than 50 dollars.
All over the whole, including <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've been used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be of evil humor, when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you <unk> you.
<unk> <unk> of the kid that you've got inside.
Sometimes people tell me that I think I think they look like <unk> or I remember them to their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is key.
If you think you're very good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the age of 30 I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and the outside, you don't look like you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for no one of this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people were approaching this week just because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally <unk> to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> and <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and I get it up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a depiction of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For instance, this would be someone who's completely logical.
This would be someone who is totally intuitive.
So where do you take your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physicists <unk> we need quite logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments actually work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We get to play with them and then we see how we <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
A little intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is that it says that one thing can be only at a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound rare to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and he didn't do very well, they always <unk>
But I bet you play with this bar in a parking lot a little bit of a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow the <unk> and that stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist because they don't play with parking bars and play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of weird things -- like they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And so they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point, the physics was a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well for my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't really play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But either. I didn't fit my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of <unk> <unk>
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I felt much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see it's been on a quantum <unk>
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in here a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a good zoom in right next to little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of a little bit of metal <unk> and <unk> and <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost in the same way you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a whole new silicon chip. and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this <unk> hole that is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird, but then when other people are getting up, I let those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> <unk> <unk> are not just people, it's also the light that we <unk> and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We <unk> the lights then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air -- and then they put it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when being only in <unk> the little metal piece is free of acting as he wants.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very weird ways.
Instead of staying in perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way it <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving you a soft thrust, we were able to make it <unk> and that doesn't happen at the same time -- something just happens to quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing, and not even <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still and at the same time that those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years -- because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom -- and that little piece of metal is roughly the same as little metal between that little metal and you.
So if one only atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you be <unk>
I mean, it's my really logical part of speech.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would it be that?
How do you play your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we <unk> it and we turned the lights up, and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects in the elevator is actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about a lot about quantum mechanics and claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not quite true.
It's more than that, it's <unk>
It's that these connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally, define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and <unk>
Lots of negotiations and stories were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story explains just in this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and art artwork.
And so when I started traveling and I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
I would better show you the demo for then to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from the launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the <unk> gallery at MoMA, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm going to go into one of my favorite ones, the New York museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already within the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the top, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the hall,
You go forward. You get <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in <unk>
I see the <unk> sign
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here is all the <unk> information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get to 10,000 million of the pixel here.
You can zoom in around in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I met something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
I entered and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And so a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper into and see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll really see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're quickly going to jump back at MoMA, in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this work <unk>
It increases and really <unk>
I go to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everybody, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can online to create your own museum, to create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walk in, I've created this function I call "The <unk> of the <unk> -- we just <unk>
It's about "The National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things didn't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even didn't come from museums either.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to your artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the great question they do today is, "You are doing this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> an <unk>
In our lab we call it design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm of <unk> Italian, all the children in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of their bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened something really interesting to the races of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
Now, some of the time ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, I took a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you earned the career.
This is what it is in engineering, and this is <unk> control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
The interesting thing is that real-time control systems are beginning to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics systems.
They're going back computers to the open.
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As I note aside I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the prefrontal cortex but represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of <unk> consumption -- and even 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from a <unk> exhibition for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, they start <unk>
It's kind of like almost all of the existing atoms they become sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the whole interaction of the interaction that we have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says he took the hammer and he threw it to the Moses of Moses -- it's actually still seeing a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what doesn't you <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of it.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer hopefully 2006.
It was the year that Italy, won the World Cup itself.
Maybe some of the remember, playing Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by observing the <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
In the early afternoon, there are people around here and doing call <unk>
It starts the silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people make a quick call <unk>
Second time. End of time <unk>
First time -- a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night everybody went to <unk> to the center.
You see the big summit.
The next day, everyone went to the center of the <unk> team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, at the time <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume them.
Today we know all about the <unk> of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that have all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, one tag on the garbage -- and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
You go from <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening very complicated things and there's a lot of transportation <unk>
But the other thing we think is that if we see every day that the cup that we <unk> it doesn't know, that it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we dropped on one day is still there.
If we showed that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and lots of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about in the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of water in public space, in architecture, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, the new technology, to join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that you have a <unk> and you have a <unk> <unk> valves that open up and <unk>
It was created as a curtain of water, with pixels on water.
If the pixels can be written in them, show you patterns, images, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open up so we can happen, as you see in the image.
This is the mayor <unk>
It liked a lot.
And we <unk> a commission to design the building on the entrance to the <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no doors and windows -- but when you come up with it opens up so you can go through.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture goes up like this.
So those days, there will always be someone in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you lower the whole architecture of the architecture away.
Here it is running.
You see people <unk> so on the inside.
And here I'm myself trying to not <unk> when you test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All the children of <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you go, but a building that kept making <unk> and water holes and you had to jump out and not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of how people will give us our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have little helicopters in the air, and every one had a small pixel in which it changes color as if it was a cloud that's moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, that moves with other in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
It's a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what changes is the light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play with a different type.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can get near and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the lights lights up, this is what we saw before.
Imagine every single one of them <unk>
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers of today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movement and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left, you see the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can break all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment as a <unk> nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine we could make everybody else a little bit for a <unk>
And I think that what happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went through the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- the Obama campaign is <unk> we can go through the digital world of the entire world of self-organizing power.
In our case, this may want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how do you go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixel in.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the pixel <unk>
You can move around, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom -- it will serve to share the main moments of 2012 and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new <unk> in London.
You can get there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than these are <unk>
Suppose I told you that, with just a little bit of changes in your genes, you could improve <unk> by one more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in a better way, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and sure about ourselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What's the most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose anything?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED conference but today I want to give you a doctor of a physician on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called <unk> <unk> in biology makes sense except to light from <unk>
But if you really accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It's about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end is, of course, the ones that we're interested in.
<unk> of a common ancestor with the modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There has been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We've been here for <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is about the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like insulin <unk> but it's the same <unk> <unk> that comes out of <unk>
And if you talk about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think -- when Antonio <unk> you take it from <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is an wonderfully wonderfully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that can want to want to have no effort in their part.
It's really like a quick pathway for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush to the <unk>
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients, nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in some kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something perhaps better adapted to <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is as a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single and unique human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by <unk> and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental about the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell is simply splitting and all the genetic energy of that cell is transferred to the two daughters.
But when the organisms appear -- things start to change.
It goes into scene sexual reproduction.
And something really important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body goes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student thought, well, <unk> <unk> death for me, looked pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening every time I was more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still lie in Las Vegas in its years in its years.
And one night someone hits their door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a beautiful dancing dance.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "It's George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to get healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to happen the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are as <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic charge to the next level, and then let us fall to the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that put <unk> Allen when he said, "I don't want to make immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you not <unk>
Evolution is not necessarily changing longevity.
Not necessarily favors the bigger or the stronger or the faster and the faster and even the <unk>
Evolution favors the best things adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish migrate to the empty, yet have managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look at the moment, I would argue that there are lots of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut out of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we become so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation for necessary that evolution happened.
A second possibility is that an evolution of the natural traditional type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when you kind of <unk> planets are going to have the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, a sexy possibility and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the choices that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what is choosing as individual and family level.
Think of that if we could be able to choose not only sex from its <unk> but in its own body to make genetic settings to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
Don't want to do those changes in your <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13.
<unk> million dollars.
A year after being finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost close to the <unk> and a week.
Not very much to make the human genome -- and it will be increasingly available to all of us all.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from them but they're going to engage against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the vaccine with the flu <unk> on the <unk> cell <unk>
Can you imagine something nice to come out of the <unk>
That's reality today, and in the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only another two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if they could change sperm and <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, to reduce <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes for preventing diseases also will allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the <unk> machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this into the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to turn the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that I normally could take 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are elections.
We're going to use these choices to <unk> more successful, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to choose to selectively <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more <unk> and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom we need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you might do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to <unk> <unk>
So immediately they looked at them, and they said, "No problem. We probably hit some <unk>
The pilot already had <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three minutes happened at the same time.
The pilot will <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Often that is not the road.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
I have three words more than ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about it, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> anything in life.
And that urgency, that way, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington -- that I wasn't a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and with my mistakes I've tried to improve all I did.
But in my humanity, I also gave place to my ego.
And I regret the time that I would argue with things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
You feel <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> will be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, like, wow, I'm not scared.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that <unk> <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> as a kid.
And to me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
All over all, the only goal I have in life is a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, of not dying that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live differently.
You who are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, how do you <unk>
What is it that they are trying to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How could their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most great thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> <unk>
One day he came home after he walked and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, you have total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design and animation design and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is a lovely thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he will be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "Wait a second, not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be someone important, and you have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Anybody seen the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate from that way, they get <unk> with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I came up with the single desire to deliver a check and instead signed a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I stayed with her brother and her father there at that particular time, "All right, this is Tony Tony is going to be building a machine, and we're going to find a way to turn it back again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in their own cannot be <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> which has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser, laser draw on that and record negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of all, they start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of moving things on one side to another we had done a couple of things.
One is, you touch the doors of the insurance companies and we get a machine so that they could <unk> it could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "You don't know," this guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all the world's <unk> world of all the corners of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid, and when they <unk> would have taken out the frames of the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks <unk> we went to the <unk> <unk> and my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk>
These are a pair of cheap <unk> that we buy in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a camera -- <unk> <unk> we put it on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- you build yourself, we published the code -- we published the software <unk> the software goes down for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There are no insurance company.
There is no hospital that I can say "No."
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming, intense <unk> all night, Tony went back for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We <unk> the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the middle of the hospital.
And he went back for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking spaces, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he was like, "This was the first time he drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and he finally came to <unk> and they would get me out there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all sorts of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were <unk> "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the best invention of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best of all of this -- and this is what ends up <unk> the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> <unk> in downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible, do it happen.
None of us in this room was possible -- the stage, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology, just I just recognized something and I was excited about people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something we feel that we need to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are often very difficult and at the same time as dangerous as well.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, much of my career, I have been interested in situations in situations and horrible with the only goal to try to look at social issues in ways that are going to do interesting attractive, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that was <unk> and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'd come up here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights for the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and according to content could be <unk> especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But said that, it's a very good opportunity to <unk>
You know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had done it a year ago I hadn't been able to do it for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the marketing world of <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've been terrible in situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be so difficult or so dangerous as I enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about the <unk> of products, the marketing and the advertising, and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> and marketing and <unk>
The movie is going to call "The <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that everything on top at the bottom -- he has a quick glimpse of them all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title is the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> of the X mark in the title but we're going to make sure we put all the categories we can in the film.
You may have a shoe and get the most cool shoe you have <unk>
The most great car you've driven in "The <unk> <unk> the best <unk> of <unk> <unk> of "The <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing you the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> Making the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film was transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the shot at end.
And I would love to make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear it, it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it's going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it's going to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: One and a half and a half and a half -- <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard with them but definitely will be worth convincing a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment it comes out of the movie that we can see as a bunch of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or for being me?
JK:
MS: <unk> means you're not really optimistic.
So I thought, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about which brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go. <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought, <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation <unk>
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of you wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today -- this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the whole media, not the idea to tell with that new vehicle that's worthy of attention to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such thing.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are <unk>
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices, being the last line maybe the biggest line.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- even the CEOs <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make something suddenly changes.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  Like that weird bear, which is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want them to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but we want to make a story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there he is, staring at me as used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I met John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take the <unk> and go to businesses myself with all my team.
So what I started to figure out, and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, enormous, giant <unk> and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make films of big Hollywood movies, they say that the reason that their movies are so successful is due to the markings associated with them.
And then my friends who make films and they say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The greatest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you pretty cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before you <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have a lot to be a man like a solid, solid, <unk> <unk>
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are <unk>
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So doing things like this, you know, remind you <unk> people are the reason that we're interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you <unk>
How do you keep you fresh, more <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: reviving the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the type of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, lots of gray colors, so many gray things.
And they usually wear <unk> as sunglasses, or I like the crystals and the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, I would call it <unk>
Woman 2: In part <unk> partly <unk> in part <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the <unk>
<unk> toys to pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because I <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be <unk> but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they could do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These shape shape my way to see the world.
So, Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we <unk> as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All those things come from and start in a place and in my case they come from and start in my family, in West Virginia.
AT: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff. I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about <unk> why do you do that?
What's the <unk> What is the <unk> What is the <unk>
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
I don't have to be <unk> What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. Big <unk> <unk> <unk> Thank you very much.) Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to go out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things around this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong points or in the other rather time to focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's nature <unk> to avoid the things that are not <unk> avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually <unk> and you make some positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other marks are this?
The first here is <unk> Apple.
And you can see here in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and brands all those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> brand is something quite powerful.
MS: <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to <unk> your own identity, your personal personality and what would that be?
You are a <unk> attribute you are somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you a good <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like playful as playful as <unk> contemporary -- <unk> bold or bold as <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're very traditional established, <unk> <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
You're good, stable, familiar, sure, <unk> <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would not have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of the desire centers in the brain both for commercial marketing like film.
We went to San Paulo where <unk> <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are going into the way in schools with available problems in the U.S.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects I have had the greatest answer or the ones I've been doing more success are the ones I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took away their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something going to make people think about people, who will challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They did succeed?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> Let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a period of two weeks ago.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film was still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies that we talked to do to their clients not be part.
I've always believed that if you can take risks, that in those risks are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that's pushing them to failure.
I think when you train your employees in <unk> risk is preparing your entire company to <unk> rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give the fear.
We need to put that bear into a cage.
<unk> fear -- <unk> risk.
From <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to house transparency.
Now more than never a bit of honesty is going to travel a long way.
And I said that, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk, <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation -- a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED <unk>
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
His biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows into a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray box so we are ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a Windows.
<unk> enter the gray box <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was absolutely <unk>
The only thing you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like wanting to do something with these <unk> <unk>
And so that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they spent very weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a rat rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense to me.
And then of having different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program he's trying to infect is actually working on that place: in the place.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that struck my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, say, for example, a <unk> power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed armed with people that obviously had all the internal information.
We would have all the points for them to attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and <unk> and let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty old as old language.
I want to tell you how we were able to find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at first were called the system functions because we know what they do.
And then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we tried to match them with the real world, with potential world targets.
We need theories about <unk> that we can pass or <unk>
To reach theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and he's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I consulted them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to put the digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part of the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the attack of the attack was to slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> runs on that code, you can't <unk>
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
It's almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in the hands.
For the fact that it wasn't like this.
The results have been from a number of weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> dead dead ends.
Even so, we found that both digital <unk> would point to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what's the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry about that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I really <unk>
There's the gray box and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the input values for the sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration of vibration and provides <unk> code, which is still running during attack, with fake data <unk>
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the safety chamber.
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator couldn't act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine goes down speed, you have to open <unk> from a <unk>
Obviously, this cannot do this a human operator <unk>
That's where we need digital safety systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> and the security system was <unk>
<unk>
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, <unk> with <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk> plant.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, how we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It <unk> as much as possible.
And if you made that, with what you <unk> it is a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All of the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We need to face the consequences and better than we start to prepare right now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public made in a lot of sides that people assume the <unk> is the primary way behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in other ways, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can carry out and give them <unk> or another thing to make wheelchair wheelchair users, and you go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that gets in the morning, it gives you a big strength, which is also increasing its speed, and help -- for example, to manage the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not an idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a <unk> charge of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic reproductive <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With <unk> exoskeleton I can <unk> 90 pounds of land for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put it in <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of the wheels, so what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in the wheels of wheels around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often with very young people, with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- <unk> against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is <unk> quickly.
Their only option, a lot of times -- by a brain injury, or some other twist -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been that over the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had a injury in the column, and as a result could not go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in crutches who send signals to the board on board, here on the back.
There's also a little bit of batteries that give the motors on the <unk> and in the knees, and they make it progress with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life, when, by a strange jump in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
On a fraction of the second, I lost all feeling and everything from <unk>
Shortly after that, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You never go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
And I stole it to the last ounce of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs a little bit of rock and even riding rocks and even assemble on <unk>
But they've never invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: So you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but by Amanda, and all of the users of the wheels of the wheels, all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is something serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, I know the cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in the Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimps, their closest living relatives <unk>
That means that we all share a common ancestor -- an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But sadly, we've made too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger to the Bonobo.
The hunting and hunting trade and deforestation do not fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
But in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have frequent sex, <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a <unk>
For us and for them, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of connecting connections.
And when you look at the game play, you see the roots of <unk> same laughter, the dance, and the human ritual is it.
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
Just that I think in this case, he love, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common both in Bonobos like humans.
And this is really interesting because we <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing elements into unusual elements -- like <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young woman, who is playing with <unk>
I think that, we sometimes played ourselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that the Bonobo gives us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world more and more difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes have to play.
But let's look at the peak of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate to play, it can be the moments that it is the most urgent thing.
So they primates, all of us are taking this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City, I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain assistant.
And in our city, where volunteers are in a highly skilled staff you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was a race to foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and find out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that has certainly gone through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while her house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>   He was first to the captain and he asked her to walk into and would save the dog's owner of her <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> for the rest of her life, I would have to tell the people who entered a building in a call to save a live living because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get the home.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and bring it to this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I went up the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the <unk> <unk> that down to that height and less had finished off the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking about, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back down the ladder where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house, the treasures at home where, as I expected, his trove of <unk> received much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the owner of the <unk> house to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at about anything else was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like in my calling as volunteer fireman I witness a acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have succeeded, or are by doing -- remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you this: I don't have it.
Don't wait for winning the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a <unk> now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a park of the neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day, we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So <unk> <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first blocks of concrete were built in <unk> with a very simple idea modules of a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like building or bridges at the same time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
He called her <unk> bricks.
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's been estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or homes.
<unk> he made it accessible.
<unk> just adopted the concrete block in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic <unk> piled on some other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create much greater circuits and more complex and brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are being <unk> so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> these are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together by magnets.
So you can't stand in a wrong way.
<unk> have a code of colors.
The green is the door, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange of color is the wire.
So you just assemble a blue one with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
One blue blue with one green is producing light.
We can put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we changed the button for a pulse <unk> which is here, and now we have a light light.
We <unk> this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a computer machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk> gestures by <unk>
To make it <unk> faster or slower, just just like this button that makes the pulse of a faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to <unk> bricks to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
So for example, how a lights in night, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to <unk> design schools.
So for example, designers without any experience in electronics start to play with <unk> like a material.
You can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> A few weeks ago we took <unk> to the School of Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, which have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, wood and paper, and we said, <unk> something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a barrel of <unk> activated <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is afraid of the darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> it became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the grasp of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all of the design and design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interaction world, is ours.
So ahead and making things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is looking at getting involved with the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You might take it a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, you know, <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technical designers to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, and we asked them to work in the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and they would be like a <unk> <unk>
<unk> some members every year, and we put them together with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
So here it appears as if I look for a quote, but what you really find is that somebody is caught by the snow -- because you know it's not very good at turning out fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help of this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time that was a long last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else that the citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, he put it <unk>
If you don't do, someone can be <unk>
I mean, you have a players' component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it spreads up.
A responsible for <unk> <unk> to see this app realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for the citizens to make the <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> but people <unk> the batteries.
That's why they ask citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we can use using it.
And this has been spread out without <unk> in a natural way.
If you know a little government technology, you will know this doesn't happen rather than fine.
<unk> acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
And then we told us that by regular channels would have taken at least two years and over two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the Western power <unk> which is going to happen 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows in a couple of days and spreads in viral form is a kind of flash of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the better government ways to work, not like in private businesses, as a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we were doing together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
It's not given to the government.
They feel a great frustration in front of it, but they don't <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings of the politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is, in essence, in words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because I can't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you're one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics don't <unk> the government itself.
And given that the government ultimately <unk> -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way of producing change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to <unk> <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of telephone and services and information.
It's the place that calls the calls if you brand <unk>
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the official knowledge base.
I didn't find anything. He started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has no call center.
Does it have a <unk> web and mobile, called <unk> <unk>
We don't have that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the General <unk> Office of Boston.
One day, this actually actually comes out of this <unk> <unk> in my garbage cube I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to volunteer <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to join and help others.
So a citizen helped another one, but here the government had a key role.
It connected to two people.
And it could have connected with the government services that you need to do, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call the animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people do it, but they think that one is the input from the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and <unk> our needs, but we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is <unk> <unk>
So below what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> which holds us that that we have funded as something that we did in our <unk> that other thing, and a result, we are losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real job of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
You've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that they've written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for the ones we have faced with government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we get to go without solve the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't get from government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to root the root function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am to <unk> I'm a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who they're going to talk about, they're all going to talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do it.
So when you face the government problem with the government doesn't really care about you to hear your voices.
They're using your hands.
They put hands into the work to program applications that make applications better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those <unk> and lots of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we are not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we didn't get <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things we have to do together, we will be a swarm of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing about these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are saying here are impact on the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have otherwise.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was <unk> it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and her experience with slavery was <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit, and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, he came back to me and said, "You know, you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I was <unk> again, and if I said yes, I left peace.
I had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to her.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of 10.
At occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running around everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up a morning, I went to the room, and they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it, and he looked at him, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up in the room, I took my hand up and said, "Come on, <unk> we're going to <unk> them.
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> who didn't. He said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just do I want you to ask me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "What first I want you to do is you want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do is you will always do the right thing -- although the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I <unk>
And then finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
I grew up in the field, in Southern <unk> I have a brother a year old and a sister a year.
When I was 14, or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just saw the <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. That's right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take you <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I had something -- your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good enough.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I got the look at it with strength and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spread <unk>
But I am 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this as a <unk> I mean by the power of the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really don't make sense of it.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My whooping died of age-related <unk>
And these were the things that I think about it, we should <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
In America we have the biggest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities, you find so much <unk> so much despair.
One of three black men in the age of 18 and 30 years is in jail.
In urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore <unk> Washington, from 50 to 60 percent of all young women are in jail or in parole.
Our system is not only distorted in the race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that is a lot better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is what the results of the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and <unk> make us believe that these are not our problems.
We are <unk>
I find it interesting.
We're looking at our work on some curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you get rid of rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it into the next 10 years the level of loss of rights is going to be as high as before it was before the law of the right <unk>
We have this staggering silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where 13 year-old children will die in prison.
We have in this prison country for children, without any chance to go away.
Now we are in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They killed people on death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crime crimes -- but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty is defined by error.
In every nine <unk> people have identified one that is innocent who is <unk> and released from death row.
A error, <unk> an innocent one in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation <unk> it would never be allowed to be able to fly planes if every nine you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> history I tell you about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities, people were afraid of being <unk>
They worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what they defined their lives.
Now there are older people who get close to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you offering talks, you <unk> people to stop saying that in our history we do for the first time with terrorism.
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we <unk> with each other.
We're constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a real truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany taking talk about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my talk, and he said, "You know it's rather disturbing to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> We don't have death row in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we could ever get to the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> we could put people going.
I think about this.
How would we be in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We couldn't do it.
It would be irrational.
And yet there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology. <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, these realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, and <unk> <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both of these things.
And lately we talked about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more commitment to the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means that it will spend more time thinking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that never come to TED.
And if you think about it -- in a way, something that's inside our being.
We have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
That's how we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual <unk>
The development of innovation, the development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas -- also by the heart of the heart.
This connection of mind with heart is what drives us to look not only in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader <unk> was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in sites of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect to do with technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> <unk> by injustice.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity, than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young, young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to talk.
Occasionally, the lady was called me to say to me, <unk> comes the old lady, we're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I was like, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well and what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read him <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks went to me and said, "Now, let me give you this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end the <unk> of life, without free freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave her all my best speech and I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "This is why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find ways to deal with those challenges, that problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than the worst we have ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced if somebody says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
But even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people that should be <unk> by law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, because of our design and our design or rational.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not the way they deal with the rich and powerful <unk> but because of the way the poor, treat the <unk> <unk>
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound themes about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired, <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these guys that have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my <unk> clients and 14 years old, who have been <unk> as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone in what it isn't it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a kid.
One night I was late in a late evening I was awake <unk> God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a small poor, black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my 14-year-old black client to be treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> CEO of a <unk>
In the <unk> I found that there had been <unk> <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there's no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only the <unk> was sent to the cut.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got to the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally fell in the car. I walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And then I approached myself and <unk>
And I was focusing on my ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected deep into my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk>
People started to reach. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
You get the <unk> the prosecutors <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people, and they're all mad because we're talking about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look around the window and let them hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking around and over there.
Finally, this old black black, he entered the room and sat behind me almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> over the old black black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, I looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and he said, <unk> this young person to keep her view of this young man who will keep his view of <unk>
I've come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds out towards justice.
We cannot be truly human human rights if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity and creativity should be <unk> to <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of all, to those of us who share this, I just want to tell you to keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> you hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, in this community, to help in your case, to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will make an effort to <unk> the funds you spend today in a policy policies.
For instance, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the cases of homicide and <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get anything.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that they <unk> these funds to make the law, the safety of safety.
I think there's a very <unk> opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you that you think is it?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's for the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increases in the population of <unk>
And we let us convince ourselves for the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> to steal a bicycle, by small crime against the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing by anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about this right now.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that media media prefer <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second every day, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient snippet of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, <unk> <unk>
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> of <unk> stories to look at the <unk>
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all of the digital devices will give us negative news give us negative news, seven days of week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be <unk>
But maybe not.
Maybe, instead, what happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the scarcity of water and <unk> without any doubts we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> problems, and in the long time, we just went with them.
<unk> then happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average per capita income is adjusted for inflation all over the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food -- of electricity, transport and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living in an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> more and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the last century, would ever have dreamed of such <unk>
We have a lot of this technology and then lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and double the price of price in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that's -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession, in <unk>
It's the output of fast computers that are used to build faster.
It doesn't stop to none of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> in one law on the left, it's going up.
The growth rate of technology is actually faster and faster.
And in this curve, to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite computation and sensors and networks, the 3D printing ability and the ability to democratize and distribute really personalized production on all the planet, synthetic biology, the fuel and digital medicine -- the vaccines and digital medicine -- the vaccines and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw victory on "Jeopardy" <unk> <unk>
It was spade.
I sought in the newspapers the better headline than <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
He plays the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the mobile phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have been done.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that stuff that's bare and making it <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a <unk> story in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> <unk> ate out of silver, and the same <unk> with <unk>
But King of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most precious metal on the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the Washington Washington Washington has <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as pure <unk>
It's tied up by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came and did something so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
We have this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in one year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about orangutans, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the late parts of the decade, in the middle parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents per hour -- compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
So let's talk about wars right now.
You remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager <unk> ship to the Earth, in 1990, after it passed away.
You have a famous picture -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> water is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's an available technology not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes <unk> <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small fridge <unk>
It is able to generate 1,000 liters of drinking water to the day of any <unk> <unk> water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents the gallon.
The Coca-Cola president just thought that I'm going to make a significant test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that I would be, Coca-Cola is going to be able to implement the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an ongoing innovation for this technology that there is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent of the mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has a better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that the President Reagan 25 years ago.
And with a smartphone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars <unk> video, video libraries of books and music, technology diagnostic technology -- now they <unk> and lose value value with cell phones.
Maybe the best thing to do when you get the applications in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging to the teams of the world so that we <unk> these technologies in a mobile device with the talk, and because it has <unk> you can get blood out of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a medical team.
Imagine this particular device in the middle of the developing world where you don't have doctors, where the charge charge is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this <unk> device, a RNA virus or DNA that we don't want to call the <unk> and first of all, prevent the epidemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of plenty.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of 7 billion.
By the way, the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, I'll go from two billion billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add up to global conversation.
What are these people?
What <unk> What <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we will have the biggest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> thanks to the <unk> of a better education with Khan Academy and because of using 3D <unk> and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion more members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What did these 3,000 billion?
And if they're contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X X is that small, teams of their passion with a goal, of course, can do things that could only do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really <unk>
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They have played with this, university teachers among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went together and started <unk>
And it has shown today that the machinery of human patterns of human patterns is better folding than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me an enormous confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion for the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that we get focused on to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades extraordinary in front of us.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You might think it was <unk> but it didn't.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was very caught up to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of <unk>
But we've heard this story many times about the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still say they follow <unk>
So what's going on here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, about <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 walls, the black beard <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so it was more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five inches.
It <unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing in changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose to the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this very bad boat, it's called the <unk> four.
I ran out to fish in it, and we did study in the south of the Sea, <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny about <unk> remains fish of coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start commercial fishing.
The bottom is a solid background of soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> because they were dead.
We once capture a alive.
I still wasn't <unk>
And so they wanted to figure out because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains of what they collect the fishermen every time they have never developed.
But I have no <unk>
We <unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
They would take the start to start at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you <unk> this happens something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> <unk> the water supply, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation using the images to the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing and <unk> forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But you don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And in the end, we keep on <unk>
And that, in large measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer that they are not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when <unk> societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because of course, an animal that's very abundant -- before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a huge loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea synonymous with great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them would have a few <unk> like captain maybe looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or, usually they don't use the scientists of the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
From there the enormous role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we actually recreating the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and is very low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have access, like the people in the West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay <unk> 500 years ago.
And you might have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are kind of <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> I would talk about the story of <unk> why do they <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only thing to give, is to Cameron, I do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and watch YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see today why the videos make viral and what's important to do that.
We all want to be <unk>
But today, the web video makes any of us, or from our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
It goes over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of those, she gets infinite views of <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this filmed outside his house in the National Park <unk>
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This chart shows the views of the rise of the last summer.
<unk> didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published lots of videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this urge to <unk> the video to be popular.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everybody wants to come up with the weekend of week,   <unk> Friday. <unk> Friday.
<unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows how often we use use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular morning.
Well, it took <unk> and lots of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science Foundation was one of the first people to do a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trends will embrace a view of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who shared this big internal joke then start to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> animation, with a <unk> music.
That's the way, that's it.
This year, you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three million hours that has seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats look at the video.
But what's important here is the creativity I woke up between the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version to the ancient one.
And then it became international <unk>
Suddenly, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today it's not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Spanish Rebecca or <unk> <unk>
What script might have been written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video climb up a minute, only the only thing and unexpected can be <unk> so these things have done.
When a friend told me I had to see this great video of a kind that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't really bother me.
Casey <unk> I am <unk> <unk> <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent yourself properly from the <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect, and its humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million to see and understand her idea.
So this approach is worth everything new we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities, creative communities, to participation, how unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- a new culture, that we all have access and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> began on YouTube.
Don't give you permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owner of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media, just the current means but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the only one of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> enter in <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally <unk>
The words, for so long, friends, now I <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life was destined for the <unk> of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> that <unk> the fiction, a boat was slid into the sea dressed in <unk> ship.
All adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was <unk> the rape and death.
Like most of the adults, my mother was wearing a <unk>
If we first <unk> we would take my sister and I, and then she and grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the motor -- the <unk> diving into every wave, and the horizon horizon and a vacuum.
I don't remember hackers that came several times, but they were <unk> with the balls of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not to be able to start for six hours.
But I know I remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to end the journey was too much to compete with, and the first apple I did, given by the <unk> men.
No apple had the same flavor.
And after three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations to form a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrant <unk>
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The odor that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> fragments <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Still, I found time to study English and get a degree in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and they had an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it wouldn't mind what was supposed to be <unk> who generally was <unk> was always <unk>
Two middle pairs for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because he had to last six years.
And I had rare and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
The house is, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was <unk> determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women were going to come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry and <unk> and <unk> boys caught up between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> relentless <unk> with what I <unk> myself.
In the other one, I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many were given help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was choosing the Australian youngest of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to another, but the edges of the <unk>
So <unk> <unk> resident in <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist and a social activist invited to speak in sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> about the day of each one and <unk> <unk> three in the same bed.
And I told my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we left the ship.
The "no" had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, "and you won't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, a lot of them doing what they were doing -- living on the boundary of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a newborn new <unk> and not just it's good, but it's something that being grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, an optimism <unk> a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I took a small group of people who the motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I made a giant pot of soup that everybody <unk>
They <unk> even at the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some bright ones, and we open us up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared for.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of her husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause she did, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
The cannot be done proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a hotel in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell stories and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night, a Buddhist came up and told us I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked her to <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you've taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how the life is to us, we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have <unk>
The defeat would be very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might want to wish that to you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy, <unk>
I can give you a <unk> in your life, and you see brave in each wave, the constant pace of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it to a <unk> I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is here, in the fourth or <unk> row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the former Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians we wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I <unk> the great prince of Indian warrior -- Indian warrior -- I was <unk> I would pull a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, she could clean up.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we released was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that's a great deal of me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy the ability to enjoy a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
As a girl my grandfather gave me her her <unk> <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with <unk> of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling of the <unk> the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent it <unk>
We <unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up with this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
I <unk> books from the age of 16.
So when I saw the iPad when I saw the iPad and I saw a <unk> device capable of connecting the readers of the whole world.
Can we know how we took the book.
Where we are, where we are.
You bring the text into the image, the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that mean?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so this --  says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several moments I get a <unk> the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but on that <unk> <unk> to those ideas that <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out to me.
So over here, we need to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, it <unk> your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag towards this magic device inside the <unk>
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book there has always been maps, but have been static maps.
This is a map that comes in, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another important aspect to me is to create Indian content and rather contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts who are <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the chambers of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a children's <unk>
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And by talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems for the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> of <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So in order to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and, in one chapter, you get a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of photographs that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, the Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality sees a <unk> group that appears on the skin plants.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves there.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature is <unk> with technology and magic and technology and technology gets closer to another.
<unk> energy from the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and love love that we sat down through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we let patients.
And one of the things we did at the University University was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What would you <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail to listen to.
This is my Wi-Fi phone. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob and <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get 95 percent <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is about weight, not at the same time when I need to have any urgency or a urgency of that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
As some of you know, I have over 4 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect my scale to my scale and before I climb into my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure that is used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity <unk> to have more control of their health.
From the next week we are available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people <unk> from their houses, taking their pressure, they get their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to <unk> control and <unk> of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health because of the challenges we face, as the firing cost of the attention of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did would like to share with you with a video video.
We all have navigation controls in <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk> <unk>
What are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find food <unk>
But where is the <unk> closest to helping this patient?
We asked, but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience -- you see a <unk> please make <unk> <unk> where, when it's open, because sometimes they open in the middle of the office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use their iPhone, and the weeks next to use their cell phone cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to make it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you have on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that is shown in their place.
Please focus on this and not just improving health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they are photographs that can't take their cameras.
My interest in the photograph, I woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my early passion, but it was a little bit different because I used to use the camera that process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera that the process ends when the <unk> is <unk>
For me the photograph had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that I would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> street.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and <unk> but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can <unk> but I always want it to have been captured in some way as a photograph.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that is going to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem real <unk>
It's the details or the <unk>
<unk> light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it's our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here's three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways you can create something that still seems <unk> as if it existed.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different <unk>
And the things that make a picture as realistic as I think are the ones that we don't even understand the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining pictures is very important, because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say there are three simple rules to keep doing realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images are done with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make you impossible to distinguish the beginning and end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape, and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs in different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that would find you because you don't need to put the ideas in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to find them to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a <unk>
And yes, even <unk> the top of the top of the island to look more <unk>
So in order to get a realistic outcome, I think it needs planning.
You start with an idea.
And then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures of the pictures that you can be very beautiful, and it can be very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like many other people that we often see, is a kind of straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something weird happening.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why would we <unk> <unk> curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve that, say, these are the years or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to <unk> the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve would be very dumb, would you see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport technology is as fast as the <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There's no <unk> in the history of technological development of <unk> growth that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these <unk> curves that are not still forever.
You can't hold this as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it will become a typical curve, I know like this until it comes out something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we now would be in the middle of a transition.
This line is in a transition from what it used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is: What is that new way that embraces the world?
Where new state runs the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future happen in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is happening.
That happens a transformation, we can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how that transition might be.
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So you go back two and two billion years ago when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that those chemicals are organized -- we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is, at that time, there was a <unk> of oil with all kinds of prescriptions that were chemicals inside.
Some of those oil drops held a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring out of the outside of the exterior and so drops grew up growing up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> <unk> a distribution of chemicals that we <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow <unk> become better at the time to incorporate chemical chemicals together, <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, chemistry -- very simple, but things would be interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In some ways we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without a sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what were in order to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same system of writing.
In fact, every living living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> we can now write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the Internet security.
But <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and <unk> it 10 at the 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If you were a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells <unk> <unk> <unk>
But then another big step happened in which things got very different and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information and to communicate information forming as a cell communities.
I don't know if you know, the bacteria can exchange DNA.
In that way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would get communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and set up a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community were <unk> and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the entire recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years old.
And at that stage we have communities, <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't run without the heart of the heart, or the muscle, or the brain and so forth.
So these communities evolved and created more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
<unk> are the devices that process the information that those cell cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the structures that are responsible structures to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at the time as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So a could, for instance, learn how to eat any fruits because I knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that because of evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit of them.
So the fact that the nervous system would build these information structures really accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the <unk>
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea that was <unk> in the head.
I'm sitting here sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in his heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we made it sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started <unk>
We now move through periods of similar periods to organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and processing information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the video tape <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> and so on.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the <unk> evolutionary <unk> where it produced some evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time again.
The first stages of history I told you took a billion years ago each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
The <unk> the language, so on, took less than a million years.
And all the time as electronics, seems to take a few decades.
The process <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds up its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we looked at in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I get life to design computers and I know that the mechanisms that I work for <unk> wouldn't be possible without the scientific advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor on that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine, and the machine with that does something that you could not do before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes there are methods that don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please give a computer, you can run a hundred million <unk> instructions.
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all these programs, and take the ones that are <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to give numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are more coming up to command numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random random sequences.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences.
They <unk> those and <unk> the rest.
And now we <unk> the best things that the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, which is <unk> children, who are <unk> and that the children will <unk> the properties of these two programs.
So we get a new generation of programs that were a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
<unk> again.
So let's take some mutations together.
And it tries new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent to millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in kind of complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are <unk> absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
They're <unk> <unk>
But do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were doing it.
In fact, their lives depend on it.
I was once in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulls up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer <unk> Don't make you feel <unk>
We know that <unk> processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
However, we don't understand all the choices there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant in our part to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of creating whatever it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I deal with my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We are near the end of the end of the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we're talking about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means that <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to <unk> the very first base, not come to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You know how to call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really, well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player at the League <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> in a regular <unk>
Now <unk> this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has a record for 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a distant place, and a dear self has two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor brings it to a cardiologist whose record <unk> is <unk>
But you know what?
She's remarkably <unk> this year.
And its hits and their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I would ask you to ask them.
What do you think should be the average of <unk> of a heart of heart or <unk> from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I got involved with the <unk> <unk>
I would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a partner in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood exam.
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> in the University of nurses at the General University of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every carotid artery that comes out of <unk> the <unk> differential <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of medical school with the impression that if you <unk> everything, then you would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady in the emergency service where I worked.
At the time, I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room asked a cardiologist to go to that patient.
And he will report the head of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when I <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which was <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart keeps working and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
And I did it and I started working on the treatment that I was <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to relieve the pressure in her heart.
I gave it <unk> water pills so that I could get it liquid.
And in one hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I sat very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two mistakes more.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, he would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that was constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
And he sent it to her house, he didn't write attention to a voice in my inner that he would say, <unk> it's not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so safe that I was asked to ask the nurse that I would go to the lunch lady -- "Do you think it's okay if you go to your <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to the full <unk> "Yes, I think it's right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high and the ambulance together with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, I had a bad <unk> in our stomach.
But I kept on with my job.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where I was my car to go home. At that point, I did something that I don't normally do normally,
It happened for the emergency room service home.
And there is another nurse, not the <unk> of Mrs. <unk> before, but another one, he told me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors.
Other specialists are afraid of as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see <unk> patients.
The three words are: what are you?
<unk> the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And she said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
After an hour of having come to his house, after I gave her high school, she suffered collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> brought her to emergency room with a blood pressure of 50 millimeters of <unk> which means a shock <unk>
I barely breathe and I was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave medication to raise blood pressure.
They put an <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and expected against every hope they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was obviously clear that I never <unk>
He had permanent brain damage.
The family came together together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, he left her to go. Mrs. <unk> <unk>
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks before, I was excited about it, and I experienced for the first time <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and I felt <unk> <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't <unk> with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad at it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was that we are bad.
And that meant feel.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would give things up, and he made sure that I wasn't <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her to your house?
And in my worst <unk> Why made I made a <unk> <unk>
Why chose <unk>
Little to the feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, he was opened up the sky and finally came out, and I wondered if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with myself where if you ask the efforts to be perfect to do not make more mistakes, I would stop those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it was going to happen.
Two years later, I was <unk> in the emergency department in a community hospital in a Northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into his throat, I looked at his throat, <unk>
He took him up penicillin and he sent him home.
But while he ran the door to the door still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, <unk> my boss asked me to talk to me in his office.
And I made the three words: Does you remember it?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but of the upper airline -- and that can cause the close of those go.
He, fortunately, didn't die.
<unk> antibiotics is <unk> and recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same kind of shame and <unk> and I went back and went back to work, and I returned to work, until it happened again and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the emergency turn, not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, and especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I wasn't sent home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had an calculus <unk>
He had an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned out normal. A colleague who was checking to the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the lower right, and he called the surgeon <unk>
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He gave her liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk> him.
I went through and when I noticed some sensitivity in the bottom right, called the surgeon <unk>
Both were operated <unk> and they recovered well.
But every single case <unk> me <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful has been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't go and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> to tell me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you show them that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would walk into a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure.
Of course at a party you'll hear about the failures of other doctors, but you'll never hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust that I would have a hard time looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
<unk> of the mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that can't sleep and the ones I know that they have <unk> outcomes and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you will, of medicine to people who make mistakes, we're going to get a safe system.
But that brings up two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal personal study of bad health and failures to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote to the Toronto, "Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, contemporary art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where the infections.
In this country, 100,000 Canadian people are killed by errors <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so there are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is multiply every two or three years, and we don't care about it.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have the cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with an pain in his chest, and it comes with <unk> eyes, and with breath alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
For all of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we <unk> and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, not to be no one.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, <unk> art, it's a custom to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say all of us, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And his students were <unk> <unk> down the head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, you know, you have a human, you accept it, and it's not proud of your mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They <unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in the time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human, you get mistakes.
And I feel so much but I'm an effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember.
Do you know how many choices we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
And I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average number of choices that says to pick an American American, are about 70 to a day.
Not a lot ago, in research followed for a week to a group of firms.
The researchers recorded different tasks spread by these executives and the time that we were able to make choices about these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
So naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many people belong to nine minutes, and how many of you have an hour?
How do we grade the way you drive those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the stock <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm <unk> raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
In other ways, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are you ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There were 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different fruit and vegetables and about 25 percent <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked myself, "Why don't I buy nothing?
This is the shelf of oil <unk>
They had over 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
I once went to visit the manager and asked her, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of tourists who came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
<unk> a <unk> right to the shop.
We put it out there in <unk> <unk> or 24 flavors and look at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to stop the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60 60 percent that when I had only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
What stopped when I'd stopped when there were only three percent of them got to buy <unk>
When there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, let's decide we don't buy <unk> we probably got <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices is affecting us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the topic of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at the savings of savings for about a million Americans, of this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of funding worker available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program, <unk> people to save the future.
And we found that actually there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds were <unk> there were less participation.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two <unk> the rate of participation was from 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 <unk> the rate of participation went down to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you decide to participate, when you have more options, even in that case, there are ugly consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, the more people are <unk> to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As much more options, they were more willing to invest in financial financial account.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the earlier decade we've seen three negative consequences by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision -- even when this is against the self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick up any less <unk> although objectively it <unk>
The main reason is that we were looking at that giant array of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for a contrast and to choose that awesome <unk>
I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in your business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually, what we're looking at is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange choices, there will be a growth in sales, <unk> costs, there will be a better experience in the election.
When we <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, they saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden <unk> corporation eliminated the products for the cats that are less <unk> increased <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> more <unk>
You know that supermarkets, today, offered 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store there's a 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the world of financial savings, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to deal with the choices is the engineering of David <unk> the Harvard.
All the employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to a safe <unk>
Those who really want to choose, are offered to be 20 <unk> not 300 or more.
You know people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience with all the money with all paid money to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give up a hand -- if you're ready to take the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I actually hit the <unk>
All right.
In fact, you had more information on the first <unk> than in the second <unk> but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it look better.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the <unk> problem of choices, which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very <unk> very <unk>
Why is people spending 15 percent more on average when it uses credit or credit cards that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that it looks more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And that meeting is that we would have exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
So what we added was you would ask the staff to think about the positive things that would happen in your lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their credit <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories.
For instance, this is a study we did in a project of magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> throughout the corridor of <unk> the magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds of different kinds of <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tell me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> giving a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's some of them.
If you think that the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> giving a <unk>
Well, something else.
Turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This scheme of <unk> is completely useless.
The categories have to indicate something to whom they will not be <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
I suppose who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think, if only the <unk> a little bit.
We need to increase complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German <unk> manufacturer that allows you to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build your car.
And these choices vary in the number of choices that it gives each one.
<unk> <unk> <unk> I've got 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order that the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a few <unk> four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go with a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How do you are.
If you have a <unk> <unk> button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk> them.
We found that those of many choices are going on to few choices -- <unk> the <unk> button over and over again, and more.
<unk>
If you go from few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which the information is.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice is not saying nothing about the preferences of interior decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more <unk> of <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've presented you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in your own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of an election is being careful to <unk>
And the more careful being in our choices will be able to do the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the year <unk> in the East Germany <unk> if you had a typewriter it should write to the government.
I had to register a piece of text of example written with the machine.
And so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found an <unk> with the wrong message, they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much of this would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer to print a page, that page is going to end up having some yellow printed dots on every page that makes them own a pattern that makes them from one and his printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we see what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means by using banking <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy a <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret secret service was two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know her <unk>
And I say today more likely than any of us will be a victim of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be <unk>
In the future, most <unk> crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, the protests, the protests, the protests, the opinions, the laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a major role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the United States and the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authoritative authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> <unk> last fall because of a <unk>
They put the security of the site and carried a <unk>
Last week I asked, at a meeting with British government meeting, I asked one of the leaders if <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do we have to <unk>
Well, you need to have a website with <unk> services -- <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority <unk>
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters <unk> the headquarters of the secret secret police on April 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools for <unk> the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple weeks ago, he found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
They are <unk> Internet connection.
We even had the tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks something bad, but it actually doesn't affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why would we <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's game <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom versus control.
If you could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we're going to do today, will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any government future, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions we have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Seattle in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the background, and behind the cows the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences across the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, how are the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and as soon as we got up in the morning and found it dead on the morning, because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up with a lot of the lions.
People are dying of the warriors who protect our community and won, and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
One child in my community, from six to nine years is responsible for livestock and father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to be used fire, because I thought the lions were afraid of fear.
But I realized that I actually didn't <unk> because even helping the lions to see the pen away.
Don't give me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to <unk> lions to believed that I was close to the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day, and they saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So it jumped and they killed it.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a light switch with the light to turn the lights.
And this is a little lamp.
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights on it.
As you can see, the <unk> give out the outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how you see the lions when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never went back to the <unk>
And the neighborhood in the neighborhood you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could bring the lights.
I said yes.
You <unk> you see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also being used now by all Kenya, to scare other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using to <unk> elephants from the farms.
Thank you to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is helping to raise funds, and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we put lights in the houses that don't have them and teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid on the meadows of the <unk> my father's cows of my father, and he used to see flying airplanes and said that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got a chance to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to become a <unk> engineer and a pilot when they grow.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you've got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What is the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make an electric <unk> CA: <unk>
<unk> I know they already invented electric fences but I want to do mine.
CA: So I did it for a time, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but couple of them because I got a <unk>  CA: <unk>
We go to <unk> every step that I <unk> friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little boy, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would come up all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I spent all my life in North Korea, until everything changed in a lifetime.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never gone hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so holes, we're ready to die."
He was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the short time, when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible I can't erase my memory.
A <unk> woman was dead on the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at her face without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine <unk> to North Korea in North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over one million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more prevalent the energy <unk> all around me was completely dark at the night except for the lights in the sea in China, just across the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite photo from North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans, to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, we see bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like <unk> <unk>
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely hard, but also dangerous, because refugee refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible <unk> back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was done actually, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> me at the police station.
Somebody was accused by being <unk> then my skills in Chinese language and asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was <unk>
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a fake report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for <unk> <unk>
But many can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although the <unk> had been eventually released after an international pressure.
These Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all of their world can <unk> in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to <unk> going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and south.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call with pride mine.
Even though I <unk> the life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the income exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities took some money that sent to my family, and as a punishment my family was going to be shifted to the force to a distant location in <unk>
They had to be able to run out.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went down several times.
Once, our bus was arrested and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
And he asked ask them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way down to the <unk> <unk>
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the <unk> <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned by crossing the <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again in the capital <unk>
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything for free to my family, and we were so close to me, but my family was <unk> in prison at the short distance from the <unk> of South Korea.
I went and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What's the problem?"
I was so amazed that an unknown would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I got her with my heart, and I asked her, "Why do I get <unk>
"I'm not <unk> she told me.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to get back to the <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But to achieve their freedom is just half the battle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they <unk> a new country, they start with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice English practices practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are following in contact with family <unk> but we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans, an opportunity to thrive with international support.
And I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Africa.
This is <unk> <unk> stores -- fast food, <unk> <unk>
So the city planners got together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South <unk> so that it represents something more, so they changed the Los Angeles in South America, as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the <unk>
Just like <unk> million other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles <unk> home from the food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to carry more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I would stop seeing this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out of the house, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and the solution.
And I also got tired of a handle on top of 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, it was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> <unk> we call a <unk>
It's about 45 meters by <unk>
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it up.
I said, "Well, I can do what I come to me <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
That's how I decided to keep it up.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our forest of food, <unk> <unk> you know, the nine full vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of paid paid for <unk> made by gardeners of all the city and completely volunteer, and all we do is free.
And the <unk> was beautiful.
Then somebody gets <unk>
The city was <unk> and in short, they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I said, "Come on.
An order for planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time I was not going to happen.
L.A. had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> we were successful.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, why not?
L.A. is the city of America.
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million plants.
Why on earth don't you like this?
<unk> a plant will give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Africa.
I grew up there, and I got my kids there.
And I <unk> to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
Like an artist artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> <unk>
I use the <unk> as a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> on that canvas.
It was <unk> to see what the Earth can do.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
It was <unk> to see how the kids are.
gardening is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember once a mother and her daughter, were kind of like <unk> at night and they were in my own garden, and they looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people that I was so close to me, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh no, I'm not afraid you're going to go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to <unk> but at his time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
These guys, they helped me to download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had affected her and how they used to plant her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a little bit of 50 people coming, and they work and <unk> all of them on a volunteer.
If kids grow <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you are not taught how your food affects your mind and your body, they eat blind people who put them in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which I stand there, I see boys of color that are on this path designed for them, which doesn't lead nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids that were <unk> from their communities to have sustainable lives.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I don't think so.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to get people working on the street, take the kids out of the street, who are familiar with the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you want them to take their <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very nice road road.
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, as it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if they go on <unk> and these cars go through that is not very nice.
Moreover, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads -- like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a little bit of a <unk>
The solution for that is to do roads from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can pass through it, so all the rainwater flow on the sides and you have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water again.
Noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet street.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road on the surface of the surface of the surface out there.
And first, a stones, then more and more and more, etc., and <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and damage.
Sometimes you can create <unk> with that.
<unk> is ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> <unk> like I said, so only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of <unk> <unk> to <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they <unk> they will be <unk> and they will be separating from the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you pull the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean up, and we can cut out the steel wool on very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel from it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is they're heating the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We did a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we came up with a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there, you see where we were doing the road, and then of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of charges in them, we had the <unk> and then with our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, can even double the life of the surface. It really takes a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about whether this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to cool first before you can show how the repair work?
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News News in his little gray radius.
I had a great smile in her face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> she yelled my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school from <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made them illegal to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could two could be <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going.
We had to hide books on the market <unk> so that we were shopping.
The school was at a house, over 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we would <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school was suddenly closed a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it <unk>
We were <unk> but still, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> when her daughter, my mother, to school, was to school, and so her father would <unk>
But my mother raised became a teacher.
This is it.
It was left two years ago, just to turn our home home for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate your children.
During the years of <unk> I remember that there were moments that I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of mine can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money, you can <unk> to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that's always going to be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want not to <unk>
I am 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than the age of my age has more than the age of my age, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate school in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home to the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my university degree, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who I carry on for the streets of Kabul.
My family believed in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still dangerous for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, as the mine, <unk> for them, despite the fact and even in front of an opposition <unk>
As <unk> It's not his name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter were going on the way from <unk> to her village, and they literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way for minutes.
When you get to your house, you get the phone, a voice, that if she kept sending her daughter to school, they would come back to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but it wouldn't harm the future of my old old and <unk> ideas."
What I've given to me from Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter, and that he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they often are the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like our Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are told by <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
<unk> that these changes didn't last a lot, after the retirement of the troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and their parents who were <unk> by them, that the <unk> I see a <unk> future and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I would care about it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I have never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> against him.
But you'll never get a revolutionary <unk> <unk>
They've spent nearly two years since the revolution broke inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> and so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside the country to call a day of <unk> and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were in the middle, <unk> the fall of the regime, carrying <unk> of dignity and social justice.
You've shown a <unk> bravery in the face of <unk> <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of <unk> and a loss of about 50,000 dead people, we managed to release our country and overthrowing <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I loved with a lot of other women, rebuild the civil society <unk> <unk> a <unk> transition and just to democracy and national <unk>
About 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about developing <unk> and skills of leadership.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, <unk> <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and the peace.
I found myself a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was <unk>
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress.
However, little enough, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> all the days of the days of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder <unk>
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society, made by a <unk> mindset, it was <unk> and it's away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all of us today to <unk> with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to say that we as a nation, we choose the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't bring the peace of stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society on <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both by men like women?
Maybe what was missing wasn't just women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the election, which only <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the subject of women's representation more than needing to <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to stop acting as the <unk> and call the days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not just <unk> but it also put the mercy in practice of <unk> collaboration, the collaboration of competition, <unk> rather than <unk>
These are the ideal that a Libya, <unk> through the war, desperately desperately needs to end the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> that tries to <unk> and <unk> between women's perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions of the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> that spans the entire humanity that men and women, that all the tribes and all the villages have <unk>
And so just like the uterus is covering the <unk> that grows inside the divine matrix, of compassion that is the divine matrix, the whole existence.
And so we are like, "My mercy is going on all the things."
This is how we say, "My mercy was <unk> about my <unk>
That all of us are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a compelling question that has an equally <unk> answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the fact that they all do <unk> Why is she left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He had been <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved me to New York City for my first job as a writer and an editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, <unk> me to the head of a <unk> <unk> with bullets <unk>
The man, when I loved one in this world, he put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap, of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be their story.
I don't see a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for the list of <unk> <unk> <unk> between Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
About 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions, all income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or said otherwise in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to figure out why the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I mean, I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who grabs it, and actually I was a very typical victim of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in the ages of 16 and 24 years old have three times as likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other and over 500 women and girls who are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also went a typical victim, because I knew nothing about domestic violence, his warning signals or the patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold, rainy night in January.
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a university of the <unk> <unk> and he worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a country in the field.
I had some big <unk> like apples and <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made <unk> since the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it all over the beginning, <unk> in a <unk>
We started getting out and loved everything in <unk> which was list, that I had gone to Harvard, that I would put passion to help girls teenagers, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like no one had ever done before.
And it was why the <unk> of that <unk> and work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York and leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> that I was getting in head in a physical trap and financial and psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And this is where you go into the scene those <unk>
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where I was supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe was bought three <unk>
One had the car <unk>
Another one is kept under the pillow on our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns to cause trauma that lived small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I had never come up with my hand, my life was serious <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical <unk> <unk> took five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, put my girlfriend down my mom and married me with him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were happy to live happily forever, because I loved her, he loved me.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and for the fact to form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I never would hurt it anymore.
I spent twice the moon of honey.
The first time I was driving towards a secret beach and <unk> me and he gave me so strong in the head that I would take a lot of times against the car <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, he was <unk> by traffic and threw myself a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I <unk> when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One in three American women is the victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in his life, and the Disease Control reports reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is: Why don't you just <unk>
Why don't you <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we come to the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has end to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family judicial system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time without the man who <unk> his mother.
And yet we kept wondering why it's simply not doing?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved it, would have killed me if he was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
He told the whole world: <unk> to the police, to my neighbors, to my friends and relatives, all of strangers, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as female headlines, women <unk> <unk> goods.
The question, "Why did you <unk>
And for some people is a way to say <unk> is by <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> are <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also <unk> who learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them, and they <unk> their lives joyful and happy as <unk> wives -- completely free of violence as my own.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and an survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I went back to marry a man and cute man and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to come back to you is never even more, it's a <unk> gun pointing to my head in the hands of somebody who says he will.
Right now, they're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or that they were <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting her daughter, her daughter, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my mad love <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my final request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end violence with domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need everybody.
We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They <unk> the <unk> to light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and family.
They <unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> that have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> safe and <unk> that should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years old.
And I feel that at this point, there's a <unk> tension in the room because I shouldn't have been dressed like this.  And luckily, I've brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of luck to <unk> I think.
If some of the women <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get them right now, but they found out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about as just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These <unk> are pretty much less <unk> I don't have to use.
The worst part is going through this sweater on the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so I don't do anything while I'm covering my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've totally changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I'd never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me to <unk> the back and <unk> my hair <unk>
Of course, except with surgery or a artificial tan as the one that I did two days ago for the work, there are very little thing that we can do to transform our looks, which, as shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model here.
Because I'm a nice woman and white woman, and in my labor sector, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you become a role model?
And I always say, <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, and youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I have known to leverage to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now show <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But sadly, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, <unk> just -- that is less than four percent, not white <unk>
The next question that people will always ask me is: Can it be a model when you get <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know about that.
But then what I would really tell you every one of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first.
If after this list, spectacular list, no, Cameron, I want to be model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> <unk> of American journal or the executive executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you be larger.
It's outside your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you have the studies, and you have a copy and some jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to say is, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but you have a Model <unk> of clothing for 10 years, people would be <unk>
The next question that people are always doing is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yeah, pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal domain, but it was a little girl.
And so next to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
These are <unk>
Well, the next question that people will always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too much <unk> <unk> and I will never use, except the last couple of before, but the privilege I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light and, of course, we were <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent so I can keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for me looks, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their thinking regardless of who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the <unk> teenagers who were assigned and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And only there are young black and Latino young black men in New York City, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
But how many times I am <unk> and <unk>
By researching this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of 13 girls in the United States they don't like their body, and that figure elevates to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question people ask me is: How is the life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little <unk> and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe they can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with creative and smart people and passionate about.
And that's all true, but it's just one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the most brilliant hair.
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> the <unk> the brightest and the <unk> and the <unk> but probably be the physically <unk> women on the planet.
But most of it was hard to analyze a situation of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in the perception we have about success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was enough enough to hold a camera, but I want to share with you about my 15 photos more <unk> and I didn't have a <unk>
There was no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum of care in the lighting itself.
In fact, most of them were <unk> <unk>
My story starts in a city in New York City to give a <unk> my wife brought me this picture holding my daughter on the day of her first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 and the 5.
I happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you lead to New York in a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists who were going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, never no one has <unk> with the camera.
So, we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in a way that was five years old I could understand.
These pictures are much more than representations of a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a week from October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always got the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with the whole year.
Recently, on one of the <unk> we were walking, when all of a sudden he stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> small <unk> <unk>
And he described to me what had felt about five years standing in that same place.
<unk> that remembered her heart is <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what looks at New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious <unk> of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I am always the one that takes the picture.
Today, I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you don't want to get closer to somebody and asked, do you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> <unk> group.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney <unk> <unk> like <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because members of Parliament don't keep the <unk>  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And you're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mostly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the World <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species -- of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are you important? First of all, they provide vital ecological services.
It's our <unk> of natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers to the bone.
They help to kill all the bacteria to absorb the anthrax that not being used and causing huge losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent surveys have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge important <unk>
They've been associated with the old culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> <unk> in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical <unk> <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, <unk> and the reason is because they fall prey of the consumption of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have a <unk> dogs you have a huge bomb bomb that <unk> the number of cases of anger has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up in Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there's an awful commerce of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what is they doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a training problem is not going to do anything.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that are <unk>
How can you help? It can become active assets, make noise. They can write a letter to their government and tell them we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, their neighbors on the <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because he saw flying without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I run and all I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, young, I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we <unk> it <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we got to <unk> seeds to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach local local tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were going to give them to come to work, and sometimes they don't <unk>  We were glad that the local <unk> were not agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't solve anything, we just said, "Thank God we're here."  <unk> time to save the people from <unk> from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato would grow into this size.
And we couldn't believe them, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yeah, so we don't have agriculture there."  "Why don't you <unk> "You never <unk>
I thought that only of us would have mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, they did what the English would do, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, we at least feed the <unk>
I would see the <unk> --  <unk> seeing the waste that <unk> the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from a African woman, the harm that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries is <unk> <unk> and we treat people just from two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
I try to deal with any of a different culture as if you were to be my children, "Do you want a lot."
I try to try all of a different culture of a different culture as if you were <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. "One is <unk> written by <unk> who said about everything development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened up this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided, 27 years just to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you have never got anything, you can never follow anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
He never reaches a community with an idea, and sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We put together in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what will you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once a community to tell people what to do, why don't they not, for a time, but not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, which opportunity have <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The most intelligent people in their community, you're not even known, because they're not attending their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we're working face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new field.
The profession is the family doctor family, the family doctor and the family doctor who sets up with you in your house, at the kitchen table in your coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to take away from this condescending trash where we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see asking, "How can you do that?
How can you do that?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I was <unk>   So --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away in '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of death in the spirit of business spirit.
So now we <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to give you to <unk> privacy, you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you can get in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you have to do is you <unk> this morning.
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurship is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution in the first industrial revolution in the first industrial revolution -- not renewable <unk> and at one point to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who's going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a wonderful story that was in <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> this group of people -- and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City was not within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population stays growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in <unk>  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty <unk> of New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in America in the United States showed <unk> <unk> <unk> companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few days -- <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> <unk> Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to talk to you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute, dedicated service service.
And then you have to have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the largest company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell is to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked at the 100 <unk> companies in the Carnegie <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new companies Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have common -- only one: None of them was started by one person.
I love the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
Nobody starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment -- in coffee in bars along with their dedicated comrades of bars who are going to be going to you, what someone did by this gentleman is talking about to this <unk> someone who asked you, you can need it?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> that he looks <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
<unk> around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so I don't really swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> and <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our <unk>
How do you share more our hopes for the cows stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the wild <unk> which give shadow <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always <unk> the music.  There is a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the most <unk> U.S. <unk>
I live near this house and thought about how I could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this led to me a deep gratitude for time.
It gave him clarity to the interesting things about my life today.
But <unk> for keeping this look in my daily lives.
It seems to me that it's easy to be left to catch on the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this home house on a giant <unk> and he painted on her phrases for <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflecting on their lives and share personal values in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be <unk> <unk>  Before I died, I want to sit in the line of <unk>
He <unk> I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
<unk> I want to live outside the <unk>
He said, "Before I want to be <unk> once else."
<unk> I want to go to the rescue <unk>
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes and hope of people made me laugh at me, and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about <unk> the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what's most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center we did a kit and now in the entire countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is the time and our relationships with other people.
In our age, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that we would have more power.
It's going to be thinking about death and <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than us as individuals and as a community and with more media to share hope and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, and it's very hot.
Not speech, but it transmits joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and look at this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say words that I don't even <unk> I could remember it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel <unk>
Let's get the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year when I came out of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you didn't consider it inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was a <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the abilities.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, and so that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, are diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of the development disorders that are faster up in the world, there's no cause or cure cure anymore.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years ago when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new life in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
It was living and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in the room around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that was in <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature of a child that would see the world without <unk> a human that I had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been a few difficult moments in my family, times where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change by normal.
<unk> passes through the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because they are autistic or not, the differences that <unk> -- they're a <unk> Each of us has a gift in their interior, and frankly, the pursuit of normal, is the latest sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> progress and change is dying at the time where we try to be the way everyone else.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what it must have been <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher asked me to give a communication a communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> of the <unk> of these students with his great minds, their great books and their great unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt like when she dropped the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I surprised my ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
And our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges -- from energy to a health and health care environment, each other, and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility for not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please get <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that their science is sexy and what their engineering is attractive to do.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
They don't tell us that they study <unk> but studying the <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, carefully with the <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as dumb things.
Rather, Einstein said, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies. They're ways to hook and <unk> with their content.
And when you introduce your job, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked why they're called <unk>  What do you call them <unk>   What do you <unk> <unk> and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's being supported by too much in the language area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the single design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple, <unk> phrase that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you can provide graphics that <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it is to be <unk>
I think these are just some key that you can help others open the door and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media -- <unk> <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all over the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks no matter -- and no matter -- and that when he wins, he gets it by the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> who Parliament <unk> allowed the newspapers to cite the exact words they were saying in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was due to the bravery of a guy with the <unk> <unk> name <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They put her in the Tower of London and he <unk> him, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end, he had such a popular support in London that won.
And only a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They got all kinds of suggestions that they could have <unk>
Some people wanted to call him the <unk> State <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call him <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody was tired of <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to escape power.
They didn't want to call it King if he did him or her perfect ideas.
So, they wanted to give the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invented the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> government, but it was really a <unk> degree.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign <unk> and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would you take serious with an title as ridiculous as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one, until I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> <unk> the President.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to keep there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says it is a <unk>  <unk> possible to keep waiting for a few years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and this is that the President of the United States doesn't sound nearly as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads <unk> the largest economy in the world and a fleet of air air vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have been <unk> to the title of <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of the <unk> well, it was a <unk> then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear <unk> etc.
So at the end the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to be humble to tell you that you're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
politicians try to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, reality changes much more than words than they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet underground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> of heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk but above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and <unk> <unk> with primitive tools.
Like others, I carry a cheap <unk> of light <unk> she holds her head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches and hold the walls of that hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> that he lost over the control and dropped <unk> meters on that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep in that hole at the risk of their lives with no reward, and often, dying.
I went home from that hole and went home but they would never will.
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the U.S. <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there, I met a <unk> <unk> <unk> a NGO that is done to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew existed in the world, but not to be an <unk>
When we end up talking to me, I was really surprised -- I was just trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> his stomach and weeks later, I flew in L.A. to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and he offer my help.
And so I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few some, the considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says there's now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African <unk> during all of the slave slaves in the <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of <unk>
But today, you can serve entire families for generations per capita debt <unk>
<unk> slavery is generating more than 30 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with fake promises of good education, better work for then to find out that they're forced to work without pay, low threat of violence and they can't escape.
Today, slavery operates in <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and <unk> I met the bricks.
This strange show and <unk> was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- in a heavy canopy <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads to 18 to the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> work silent, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee breaks up to eat, and to drink, and the severe <unk> would make it pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too warm to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I thought my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> which was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You know, <unk> don't do it."
And he explained to me very clearly that to show emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were.
I had to trust <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for her liberation and he trusted the <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children <unk> <unk> for miles for <unk> <unk> to trucks that they expect down.
These big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge and the children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves and work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think about sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness told me that it would be difficult for me to work safely in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> sex.
And I was driven by a few <unk> stairs that would give this dirty basement of light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are local for forced prostitution to <unk>
They have small rooms and they have small rooms, where <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven -- they're forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of it is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what should be caught in that hell.
I only had a <unk> the stairs where they <unk>
There was no <unk> doors.
There was no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a topic so hard -- it's important to point out that slavery even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often associate with labor <unk>
I went to Indian Indian villages in which there were entire families <unk> in the trade of silk.
This is a family book.
<unk> hands of black hands are the father and blue and red, and in red, their children.
<unk> <unk> in these great barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me about his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, but we can go out of this house someday and go to another place where you actually pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we there, I went to take a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishing family on a boat, two older cars, some younger kids, a younger child.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> of these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
It was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The <unk> branches of the trees, <unk> in Lake <unk> often <unk> networks and children, <unk> and fear, falling into the water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love, he was not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it is about the youngest slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which <unk> the <unk> <unk> to victims of slavery.
Kofi <unk> was possible.
Who's going to be because somebody decided to make the difference in their life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his <unk> and he was suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
It was asked by a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out pretty quickly.
Then you signal this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the way.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put pictures of my head on my head as I <unk> in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the path ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football room, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had kids strapped to their backs, and as they were looking for gold, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> are up to 300 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags and then they're going to be transported to another area where they <unk> the gold to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look more closely at the margin we see working on other fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When her father died, her uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died his uncle, I hate the debt of uncle who force it to be a slave in the mines.
When I met him, he had worked in the <unk> <unk> and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet at that, it's forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dream of being released and educated with help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of determination, in the face of a remote journey, which makes me much respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you around the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give testimony to them and we're going to do everything we can to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves as human beings, then it's very difficult for atrocities like slavery.
These images are not of magazines. These are real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights and dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I think that I don't think of these many beautiful people, <unk> that I have had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in which you can see, in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn a fire and that the fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math mathematics and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like management creation.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of the ballet <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But the <unk> for a degree of extraordinary training, a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> <unk> that can be a genetic component.
Sadly, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease, gradually this extraordinary skill as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a virtuous dancer <unk>
Over the last few years has made a lot of progress on the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately, the only way we will know whether there's a cure to be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement that are not biological <unk> so they don't use blood <unk> and the best we have is a neurological test for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside clinical trials, they never do.
And what if the patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic -- what if patients could get the exam they could do <unk>
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is, as a kind of no conventional way to a try, you see, in some sense, all of us are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of <unk>
It shows someone healthy while he emits sounds to speak. We can imagine as a dancers of a vocal <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes needed to do -- <unk> for example.
And as they did it, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Think of the time it takes a child to learn how to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as we <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the ground down you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials <unk> Well, they're both not <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both of them are <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds a lot.
They are <unk> and we all know what happens to happen.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it takes mass scale.
These are some incredible targets to <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties in the patients.
I don't need to go to the clinic to read routine.
With <unk> <unk> we might be able to get objective data.
We could make a massive low-cost mass of the clinical trial for clinical trials, for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps today, the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to tackle these targets.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> it can call low price and leave the recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people -- you'll be able to say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What will you pull out of these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have no disease or not the disease. Yeah.
<unk> You can see, some people may not <unk> You may not <unk>
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and to do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking at the <unk> the factors of the disease.
TR: Do you have a accuracy precision at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have to <unk> it has done fantastic work and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well, what we <unk> the project. We have 99 percent accuracy now.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> <unk> creatures.
We <unk> ourselves in the dark, in <unk> and we usually avoid sunlight.
We do that to the slender models even more <unk> the perfect skin, but we do the impossible for us, and we get into press the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of years of experience and a real taste of images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
So a little bit of time later, an organization where I was <unk> there was the <unk> -- he was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On 13 of May, I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing town in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level recorded over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers land inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
It <unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
They took out schools.
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> <unk> from the local system.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, the kids like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and pictures of photos and cameras and <unk> cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of the villages around around the <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up <unk> <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor of them and I had the honor that that day was going to go back to clean the photos.
This was emotional, and inspiring, I had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond the <unk> my horizons something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some people who had more than a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and met hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl didn't have the aspect of her, and that would be as tragic as having the photo <unk>
Over time, they got more lucky, and they got more <unk> so this is that he entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we get <unk> a neighbor of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of the time libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
I could engage an hour. I could make a weeks.
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw practically by hand using the <unk> areas whose color and detail the water hadn't <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures long ago in seawater, covered with bacteria, with seaweed, even with oil -- all of that along with the time of time, I continue to <unk> it was a very important part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless I was clean and dry and <unk> for his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the pictures already <unk>
As a time <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought these pictures was lucky to the photos.
I had started <unk> she itself but stopped when she realized that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face would not have <unk> we could <unk> the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When they collected their pictures they shared something about their history with us.
A few colleagues from her husband found the pictures in a fire station, between the rubble quite far from where he used to be her home, but his colleagues <unk>
The day, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go into the water while the <unk> <unk>
His little children, not as small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took a week to find her whole family and knew they had all survived.
The day he gave her pictures his youngest son was <unk>
For her, despite all of this, these pictures were the best gift I could tell you, something that he could go back to look at, something that I could remember from the past that he wouldn't have been marked by that March day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined us -- hundreds of them helped us clean up by <unk> pictures -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority of them returned to their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us give up 90 families -- completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of the <unk>
We take photographs all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one place, a relationship, a <unk>
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take off, but the first thing to be looking for.
This was the project to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone to connection with the past.
When a picture like this comes back to someone, it is a huge difference in the life of the person that the <unk>
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger with something bigger -- to bring something, using their talent for something that is not thin blood models of the perfect skin.
And I would like to read this email to me, I was sent <unk> the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the pictures.
One particular photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter <unk> hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs is the <unk> right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> were inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that's going through an apple in one of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames a second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique so fast that it can create a slow motion of light into motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-rays, and they challenge the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer and switch it on and put it into a second or a second or a second, and you create a <unk> package of <unk> just a millimeter of <unk>
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a <unk>
If we take that bullet and this <unk> package and <unk> it in this bottle, how are they disperse inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel around the table and because of the insights you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we make it go down the same distance, and we see it in a slow camera at about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to sit down to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a slow bullet in motion.
And how about <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves that <unk> from the table, the tomato wall and the <unk> wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at once more that <unk> you realize that, as the light is <unk> from the <unk> it's still bright.
Why? Because the tomato <unk> is <unk> and the light bounces inside the inside and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if your fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture at low exposure, it goes very little light out.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition -- so I'm just going to get some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude data and <unk> it <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes, they can become invisible <unk>
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could shine some light on the door. I will go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We've built it.
On the left, there is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a fraction of the photons will go back to the camera -- but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also the hidden objects, but we don't know what dot corresponds to which distance.
When you project a laser you can record a <unk> picture that you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we are going to try and analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> <unk> with what's around the curve, <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at light reflected through the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the interior of the body -- having a <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood that is quite hard, so actually this is a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new rendering of visualization to solve the problems of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, it turned science into art, an art of photography.
I realized that all of the <unk> of data that we collect every time not just for scientific visualization, but we can be able to be able to be able to look at.
We create a new form of computational photography with slow and code <unk>
And look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a couple of <unk> of a second.
But here's a funny thing as well.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are moving away from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects. And Einstein would have loved this image.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's already time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my cell phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and you give freedom freedom.
With a mobile cell can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone, you can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, and it will be famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are <unk> looking for change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, they had a mobile <unk>
Who from the <unk> have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today I'll talk about me, of my mobile, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines of information.
<unk> <unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the <unk> Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every European company, every single Internet provider in the entire Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your Internet <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> don't <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
You can store all this information on us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time, was the largest telephone company in Germany, who would please <unk> all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to you, and I didn't have a particular answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end, I <unk> an agreement.
<unk> the demand and they sent me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this <unk> on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At the beginning, I saw them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the data <unk>
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and <unk> go back and forward.
You can see every step I want that.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> on <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
But from all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talked a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they're called each other.
And then you call the other one, and then you end up with this big communications network.
You can see how people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all of this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to who, who send an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at first, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile <unk>
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who were the leaders, this never happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall, maybe never happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today mining agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century, and it's not fashionable in fashion.
When you go home, you go to his representative that just because business agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that it comes to you to remember you have to fight for <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
Not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.

It's not <unk> no <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, though they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm going to give you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you in front of you.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they wish to be disabled.
Let's go walk.
Christmas <unk> are in the shopping mall, they drive around parking lot and what you see?
It was 16 <unk> <unk>
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I've got the 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There will be a gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park, <unk> in New Jersey.
I always love my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> it to dance <unk>
If my three sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three sisters, older sisters went to public school, my parents to <unk> to the school system and <unk> that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all of the <unk> all of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my <unk> on her feet and just walking.
Now, another approach that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that I was <unk>
The <unk> I carry on was very strong and and ...
Yeah. The first day in kindergarten was walking as a <unk> champion that has received a lot of <unk>
Growing up there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 <unk> and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as <unk> <unk>
The people I grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> that die of starvation during the <unk>
I was telling you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> from dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> I'm crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to school school.
I learned to dance with <unk> whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer summer on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I was going through my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were in <unk>
On my summer holidays often my father tried to <unk> so I was drinking milk in the back, and I was <unk> <unk> in the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on my head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a grant for the <unk> University of Arizona, because I would come in all the <unk>
It was like the house <unk> from the theater.
Everybody <unk>
I did all the least <unk> tasks I took the ultimate note in my classroom, and also in their classrooms.
Every time I did a scene from the glass <unk> my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow to Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with brain <unk>
I was a girl with brain <unk>
So I started screaming at four <unk> When I end up going to have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of the <unk> <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk>
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying to historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask her why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts -- you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that literally was born and gave it to an actor.
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors with <unk> <unk>
When I graduated, I went home, and my first tour, <unk> was an extra <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the directors of <unk> did not <unk> actresses, <unk> <unk> with disability.
Just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
On my first tour, I took famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that took when she landed at the point that he was at high speed of New Jersey with a driver who had <unk>
I worked in <unk> across the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never really like reclaim the first place, but I know you've never heard that little rumor that they said women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the New York Festival in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media and to once remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arab was much easier to fight the challenge of stigma disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by cord <unk> back with Keith <unk>
I walked into a graduate dance, I went back to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clinging to the <unk> desk to get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back.
But not just Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that kids are <unk> but they never fall out of me and even older ones.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
And he was online clips like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist.
What disease is that?
We really should pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would make less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to a very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give Syrian refugee refugees a small part of what my parents would <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me live live, and I'm doing this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid in a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This people are near <unk>
<unk> drives a small town to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When you get there, there are no opportunity -- there's no job, no <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
And one day he gets about a guy who offers him to <unk> him after dinner <unk>
He meets a group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money so you buy new clothes, money to send home, your family.
They present a young guy.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a bomb.
That boy from that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were <unk> a connected organization connected to al Qaeda.
So, how do the story of a young village trying to fulfill his dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that stuck.
This was the first thing that he pulled him out of what we call "the <unk>
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed urban <unk> who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who seek something beyond <unk> <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for jobs, in well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't <unk> opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terror, to violence, to <unk> to be the story of 2.0 cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent doesn't work, not to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital -- the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in that hospital <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had forced me forced to be in that same <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few juvenile leaders at a business threshold.
It goes to about 90 baby leaders <unk>
And we sat down and we had a rainwater of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
And I remember when he said to me, because he was a graduate college university, was the perfect black <unk> for Al <unk> and other conservation organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to get from point B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> he saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
They started <unk> <unk> to local residents who were usually unable to <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and their dream is at some time to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different?
I think your ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for as possible.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years old, and until Mohamed until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were <unk> from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a <unk> and <unk> design.
He created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> that he said, could survive the hard climate <unk>
And the delivery of flowers started <unk> creating gardens in the houses, and the companies of the city, and now he's working on the creation of the world's first public <unk> <unk>
There are no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and, as he says, smell the pink pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought to work for an NGO, to work for government, but their history, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged believing they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, let's inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their own reality.
They need expertise and orientation to engage in the development and put their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to the creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, <unk> spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's a social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park.
He was willing to hire children from the street to help rent to their motorcycles and keep <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in the entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks <unk> that <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains <unk> a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was made by the leaves of leaves as a <unk> and not to be on the path that we could almost pretend we were the first human beings on the ground.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with <unk> apple balls <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they had <unk> who thought I was going to clean their <unk>
That question went with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where you <unk> the <unk> who clean our garbage in <unk>
Who clean our garbage in Rio or in Paris, or in Paris, or in <unk>
Here in New York City, the <unk> Department of <unk> <unk> for <unk> tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products -- every day.
I wanted to know you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked around the road, and I interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I wasn't just traveling in the trucks. I have the <unk>
And they operated the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you believe it, and in the days that it's very strong you were going to go down quickly.
It costs a lot of using weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies kept keeping the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and you're coming up with traffic all day all day and <unk> <unk> around you.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall down the truck and cause terrible <unk>
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always needs to be moving.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste is the most important labor of the city streets for three reasons.
They are the first protective <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste in the very effective form and effective every day, this starts <unk> from its <unk> and its dangers inherent are <unk> in very real ways.
Disease we had for decades and centuries come back to <unk> and they start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of how old we don't have space for what the engines of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger of consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed out your relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed necessary.
And I mean by just the speed of what used to be used in the <unk>
We usually don't care about <unk> or <unk> or we took us with our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- the <unk> we forgot about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that we get out of it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about using waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when to <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that they keep telling us about ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow should always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11th, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste collection on the street, grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs and he went down and she had a man doing his journey of paper paper and was doing all the <unk>
And I tried to thank for doing his job that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I started looking at the collection of waste and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we need to include and to account all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor.
The city waste, what we think about when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our communal life forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in countries -- one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of various stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that they showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many of them in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people cannot afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the <unk> cladding is turning heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city in which this shouldn't happen because it comes from a weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the entire year.
And thirdly, what has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place that was so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was actually <unk> with the old market that is this <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern <unk> of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge is presented to <unk> the site, which is located in a very much of a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of a hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the <unk> of the building.
And this spreads with <unk> <unk> which creates an outdoor space in the building that goes into its own shape and rain.
And around this space we've applied to the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be <unk> to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue that is similar to a concrete shell, to allow the air to the air and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
We then inspire ourselves in these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal fractal properties.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystals of colors that use the light inside of the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It wasn't what they <unk>
But ultimately we all realized that this market idea was much more profitable than the commercial center, because in order there were more local to sell.
And the idea of the facade was a lot more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because you didn't have to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity was short almost every day.
So we get a huge advantage to putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about ceiling as a new public space with meeting areas and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which together collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a teacher of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so big, the biggest that I have designed, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I had special attention in <unk> a <unk> structure, which was surrounded by a wall with a dozen connected doors connected by <unk> straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation we did was extend the streets that it is creating 12 very similar building blocks and features and features in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points relative to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this shifted the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell of the project, as the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So <unk> a scheme that claims most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to the <unk>
And it also responds to local rules that set up greater density at the upper levels and a lower density in the size plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost as to give the community the space occupied space through construction.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and <unk> and make activities like running a million miles per morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in the emerging world, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same pace growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture by looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improving the relationship between the community and the environment and that have a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had lots of very bright hair, and a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> was so <unk> for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy until I <unk> my sinister plan.
I was just a time after the <unk> of school. I was a little evening and hid I hid in the <unk>
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took off the table of my master's teacher.
And then I did.
I <unk> the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit, just a few Like this.
All the examples,  And I set up to bring the book back to the <unk> but some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> we would take the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all over rows of <unk> and I just line up a row of it, just for being there, because I <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing that.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was all <unk> obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I <unk> the reason why I was bothered by that this little girl as small -- was so good for <unk>
Would the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab in which we study <unk> in all their potential ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no argument, in it, it would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> no <unk> and a <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school school, because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> no <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No way! I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy I almost got them all.
This year has been a hundred years ago in his masterpiece, "In the <unk> time, the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of my own, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the jealousy that you get to the person, to your wish, your <unk> are a good <unk>
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy we tell ourselves a story.
One story about the lives of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being <unk> and audience and audience -- we know exactly what details to do to <unk> the knife right?
<unk> make us all novelists the <unk> and that's something that they had to understand.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to yourself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that you can see in his lover, he adds it to his collection of instruments of torture in his private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion, <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like great <unk> <unk> and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links the language of <unk> with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his geology <unk> <unk> listening to the doors and <unk> them to the <unk> of their lover, so those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think that this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make it seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search for truth, a truth, in fact, to what to <unk> the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> these were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to do, that makes us suffer, it causes us to be a much more profound and vital feelings than a wise man who can tell us.
We're saying we're going to go look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> can tell ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There's some other emotion of us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look with intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about it later on.
One day, Freud was visited by a young man who was being held with the idea that her woman was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird about that man, who didn't get upset about what his wife did.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that her wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
The novels described very well how the <unk> are doing to look with intensity but accurately.
In fact, the harder we are, the more we become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are leading us to make violent acts of violent <unk>
<unk> are moving us in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me about eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about the news.
A <unk> woman of 52 years was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which they were sending <unk> <unk> to itself, for a year.
For one year, a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because we are realistic.
How big -- although <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange character in the American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books who try and <unk> our minds, and once we're in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting to be what you have to take out of your self and <unk> what ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- it takes your rings, carrying your rings, carrying your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route from Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> everybody, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> he needs <unk> <unk>
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but they <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once you <unk> in <unk> to everyone with your solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems to me, very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> there's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you are on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> lets you admire that idea of being the <unk>
It might still be so simple?
What if <unk> really are a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the greatness of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember we have fiction to <unk>
Only fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, <unk> Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and the <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence on the <unk> surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest mobilization.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo delivered about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on the surface, of whom Aldrin came out of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't bring a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynics answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice at the University of Rice <unk> a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask why <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why is the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why would fly over the <unk>
Why plays Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
So we chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West over the east in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of 1993 technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> was eliminated and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what <unk> Alvin in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the <unk> crew flew 40,000 miles an hour.
In the 1970s, no human being has come back to the moon.
No one has traveled than the crew of Apollo 10, the optimism <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagine as to go to Mars, create clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> <unk> of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission <unk> but I was completely sure that I could see the colonies on Mars.
So that "Something's up with our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it over the two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists had <unk> and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that accelerate <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But we don't know, the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation <unk> in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> from the years to <unk> Intel and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> specifically, incentives that the venture capitalists provide entrepreneurs to <unk>
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused by creating <unk> ideas for funding for <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about risk, they prefer small investment investment, lower investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and developing capital in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and deep problems.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes out of energy energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at price. They don't exist.
Now, technologists, and entrepreneurs and economists are according to which policies and international treaties -- development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the current political policy that we will see an American energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that looked like technological, is not to be.
We know from time that famines are the result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are a political crisis that affects the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines as though there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon had the war in cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many kinds of cancer, some <unk> <unk> the treatment, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have been found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we do -- but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, institutions must support the <unk> it should actually be a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it works with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> difficult and dangerous -- and there is no popular mythology of science fiction as the way to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We are alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows we're not missing the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, it's a very widespread statement.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It becomes bow to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't have of course.
But I can use <unk> polls and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at surveys of opinion over time, there's not many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and political journalists still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> they are the judges, the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway down.
But this is evidence for enough?
What anonymous surveys are, of course, views.
What else can you <unk>
What you're looking at is the <unk> attitudes that people believe when they ask some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody told you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
Probably <unk> by asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other <unk>
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place the trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official official or a person is going to be a uniform in all cases.
I could, for instance, say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the classroom, but in no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but not, perhaps, to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in the form of <unk>
And I think surveys are very bad tools to measure the true level of real trust, because they try to <unk> the good inherent trial to actually trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
I think it's a goal that's stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I want to have more confidence on what is <unk> of trust, but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think those people who <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> which then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, yes, you say, yes, that means that what matters in first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a trial about how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in <unk> <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But yes, in the contrary, it's not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very confident that you can do certain things, but I see that they will take your own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're really excited to do before trust.
The confidence is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and so forth, who made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> that will <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability system that is destined to guarantee <unk> and testing <unk> actually are doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You probably all know similar examples.
We put all of that, through the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we could be worthy of trust and <unk> to the people who are reliable and whether to be able to determine whether other people people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple music, the <unk> which is not <unk>
Third, the task.
You get into the task reconstruct the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, it's signature because they give us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough so you can trust you.
You have to be <unk>
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> usually to all people, all the time.
But you also have to have <unk> evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do you do it?
That is a day, everywhere, everywhere, doing the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> no explanations for progress.
I take them and get their money, or get it back for the color that I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is <unk>
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been <unk> increasingly and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the glass glass of a <unk> screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
I first created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> on the screen is transfers by its physical body to the pixel body.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of the hands?
In the division of Science <unk> with Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
He <unk> a transparent bombsight with chambers of depth to detect the fingers and face, you can now raise my hands on the keyboard, getting inside of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a place in real space -- it's as easy to grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and <unk> lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that is down from every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information come into us?
<unk> a lot of us will afford to go through the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, rather than just seeing pixels in space, how we can make it physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
What would the future look like?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical pixel together.
This <unk> magnet is behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it of the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back and get it back and get in the physical world.
You can teach physically physically <unk> and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality sometimes that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physical physics, and unlike the monitors or textbooks, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's most fascinating to change the computer part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without having to <unk> ourselves from our world.
So we started the talk today about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I <unk> to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to invite a school for the athletes all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believed strongly that there was only one effective way to <unk> a safe job and <unk> work.
No matter if the job I would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera, Chinese <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer should start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to school school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
My friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class <unk> was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> Okay.
He <unk> the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books to do here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about life Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to me, "It's so different, and much better than it <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture has also taken place to my <unk> reading habit <unk>
They have a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning of this map, I thought to me outside because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There is to fields of research like comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading worked out to research, why not do it in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
By Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of getting lost in the translation, I found that you can get a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know that I won't feel used or <unk>
Having a dream -- <unk> is really nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness.
A dream of <unk> can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinic clinic at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> stood up on the couch in my office grabbed the shoes and said he wanted to talk about her problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My classes had a <unk> as a client.
And I played a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> <unk> that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move my head up while they <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> I said Alex, and so I could see she was right.
You start to work later on, then you get kids later on, and the death goes next.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time <unk>
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out with guys underneath your category, <unk> with a <unk> <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my squad <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe he <unk> with the next.
Also, the best time to work in the stress of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't cause the <unk> of Alex to be a break.
This caused the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem, and it had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, the families and the future <unk>
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think that no one gets to adulthood without going before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take sleep away a <unk> I want to see. It's good. They really matter.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know about 80 percent of the key moments in life going to the 35 years.
This means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and <unk> moments that give her life to life have happened to be 30 and <unk>
People in the '40s, I don't <unk>
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of the Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future mate at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up in the second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it <unk> to <unk> which means that if there is something that you want to change from themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during its <unk> than at any time in life, and we know that the female fertility gets to its top to 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time to <unk> their body and their options.
When we think about developing the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily life and common life has a <unk> impact on the person that <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the line of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence.
The journalists were <unk> names <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head, and you say, "You get another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the urgency of urgency and his ambition and this absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, <unk> smart <unk> like you or your children and your kids come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship. I'm not just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a race before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then he starts sounding something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better copy of the day that I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts sounding something like this: "My <unk> during <unk> were like the game game.
They were all running and <unk> but then somewhere around the 30, the music went off and they all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing to be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things to <unk> there's a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of you start a career, pick a city, pick a couple, and have two or three children in a much more short period of time.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show -- which is much harder and willing to do everything from <unk>
The <unk> crisis is not about buying red <unk> cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
Realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about her <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper to live with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living a few very difficult <unk> his earlier life had been even more difficult.
They <unk> often in our <unk> but then he woke up her by saying, "You don't choose his family, but he can choose their friends."
Well, one day, Emma got her head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the whole morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was watching empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was about <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of whether it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot to resist and I wouldn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like I just sit while the decade <unk> of Emma passed ahead.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or female, she deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that <unk> of that identity crisis and <unk> capital of identity.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity generates capital of identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that you want to try to go.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that shouldn't count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that would explore jobs and make it tell.
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you up at the airport, but the <unk> you come together with friends with the similar minds to the same as who you know how to know how they think, how they think how to think and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who is coming out almost always comes from their closest circle.
The new things come from what are called weak friends friends from your friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half won't, and the weak ties are the way to <unk> this group.
Half of the <unk> work never <unk> then to meet the head of your neighbor is the way to get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma thinks you don't choose your family, but I know her friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> her family when she has a couple of their own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
You might think that 30 is better enough to sit down than 20 or even the 25th and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live now, or you will tell you now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so intentional in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it or kill time with anyone who makes them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, with the living she alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married man who chose consciously <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I send myself a letter to say that he said, "Now the spaces of charities are not enough.
<unk> story can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the Los Angeles, which goes somewhere from the west.
Just before we <unk> a light light on its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years, or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea that's worthy of spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> -- not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get an identity capital, you pick your identity, you pick your family.
Don't let me define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job, in management <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them math to graduate students in New York City in New York City.
And as any professor, I took tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When the job came, we have grades.
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance had no I.Q. <unk> scores <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that set me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in math in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and over time enough.
After several years more than <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure in a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if we succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who's successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> <unk> and we tried to predict what children would be able to do as far as the competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school and <unk> who will be the most effective way to improve the results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking, what about these vendors are going to keep their job <unk>
And who's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it emerged a trait as an important success success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it was not <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long term.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination of the Chicago schools.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires of determination and then waited for more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> <unk> even the security that kids felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in <unk> National <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for kids at risk.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know the science of its development.
Every day, parents ask me, "How do the determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a strong job <unk>
How can I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't make it <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that simply don't follow their <unk>
In fact, in our data, that is commonly related to whether it's related to the viral measures.
Up until now, the best idea I've heard about developing <unk> is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change with effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mentality is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether it's been successful. And we need to be willing to fail, to begin to start everything again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the way and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for <unk> it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall Wall of China.
Over the last few years, I've been asking myself if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who wants to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast learning could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and faster.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy here.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read signals from <unk> <unk> <unk> understanding the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as you can even be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the shape of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were screaming <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol actually is <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> on the old west.
I call <unk> these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two is a company, three are crowd.
If one person reaching their arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> within the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a <unk> is pretty an idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two <unk> together, it's very hot.
Three <unk> together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun, and the shining moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Put a board inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> he played there at home?
This person is getting hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful being <unk>
So we've spent almost 30 characters.
When we use this method, the first eight radical <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a mountain of fire.
We know that Japan is the land.
This is a sun in the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun along the beginning, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains one over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you to come out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician <unk> together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand to take it.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children into a kind of industrial complex of child <unk>
However, <unk> magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal guy and a guy named <unk> <unk> a girl who would wear as a guard <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a huge difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the <unk> magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician will do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies generated by the bad <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about <unk> magician is that the most <unk> <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did "Star <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son as well.
<unk>
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had been <unk>  And so she sat in the room and was struck by a mom with her <unk> behind, and I didn't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would it be issues of value, <unk> and <unk>
It should be the sense that Luke got one to an army to overthrowing government?
<unk> this with <unk> <unk>
How does it make a <unk> of his movie?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow to <unk> OK? And not a world of men that I think is where we are.
Why is there so much economic capital force in movies for our children, and so little out of the <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence films in girls, and they should be <unk> It's pretty good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate through the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first kiss. I was really expected to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
<unk> focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, but the boys, are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job when they teach girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful topic of all time continues to appear in classic after a classic -- every single one of them about a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and her son, or two men who are <unk> a child.
So, as many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's pretty good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost no of these movies is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard of this.
It's not just the roots of the <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, of comics, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must <unk> in the film, there are more than a female who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the kid that you like.  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week went to see a very good quality, <unk> movie.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success of <unk> a sense of consensus from what is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the <unk> test.
And I don't think we <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in an embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So we <unk> in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 most popular movies, how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently to Congress, so it's okay.
But there is a bigger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he was like, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women said it's been sexually sexually sexually in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
I don't believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a huge amount of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What don't they get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our willingness to be <unk> and we expect that to <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily by parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the masculinity is radically changing.
You've read about how new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star <unk> character -- you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these <unk>
Maybe it's not just the brilliant <unk>
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to do fewer stories in which I tell my <unk> <unk> and struggle and more stories where they saw that their job is to join a team -- perhaps a team led by women, helping other people to improve and become better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things I was like most of me was looking for kindergarten at the shores of Maine -- because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I was fascinated by <unk>
I started looking at ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love love and archeology.
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up with almost 1.3 miles of length along with the <unk>
And my biscuits cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we look at the <unk>
This is a place that is located in the eastern <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, simple sight, seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and processing it using <unk> <unk> suddenly the place is seen as pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape of the <unk> materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this huge renaissance of ancient art and architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere in this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is huge, it's roughly <unk> by <unk> mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, he moved to this and covered the whole city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And then I'll find it at random that would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes and using baseball.
So, we use NASA <unk> to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where we would have <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this little high area that you see inside the circle here, that we think it might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with American scientists doing <unk> <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the <unk> <unk> but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, underneath a thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> <unk> we have a <unk> layer of years that date from the Middle Empire, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire and these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense <unk> layer that goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from a elite jewelry, which proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we <unk> the place in a future near <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in use of satellite technology, so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire and he was probably written in <unk> about 4,000 years ago:
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So as it looks like, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually start in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door <unk>
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> race and go in direction to your front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They <unk> against the door of her home.
There's <unk> everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in places -- <unk> the line.
The <unk> to the <unk> or what the other side of the door, and the quality of the light, and the light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with his hand.
So from his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that is speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> in your nose.
You can smell the <unk> and you go to a point to get into the mouth.
They <unk> around and enter her living room.
In the room, and I use peak of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little <unk> dancing on your middle <unk> singing <unk> One more <unk> One <unk>
Now <unk> the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a path of yellow <unk> and from the oven.
Okay. You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, waiting, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
I make whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the way the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be nature of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> <unk>
I asked her, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miracle acts of memory using some old techniques -- invented two years ago in Greece, the same techniques that I used to <unk> to memorize their speakers, and that the medieval scholars were used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, "How did I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful <unk> and <unk> although a little <unk> said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what it can be its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Someone who was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see what extent our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> he was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And in coming back, I read a number of treaties on memory written over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time that this idea of having disciplined and disciplined and <unk> was not a little bit as rare as it might be like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, in order to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but also have changed.
They have changed the <unk> and I would say that they have changed as well.
Like we don't have any need to remember, sometimes we seem to have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory that's this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there is <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory <unk> to the lab.
They wanted to know -- it's going to be brains in some form of form of structural form or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive tests, and the answer was really no.
There was a really interesting difference and meaningful and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them into a <unk> MRI machine, <unk> their brains while they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in the memory champions are <unk> different parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is manages as a race race in where each year comes up with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors have to put a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times the memory.
In his desk, you face him, there's 36 <unk> of <unk> cards that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques that are used at the end is reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates a <unk> paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> he says the following. And I say to two people who remember the same word, I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who told them that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who said to her work is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> capacity -- that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything to you. It doesn't have any relationship.
And all the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
<unk> well when they come home to work.
Probably some <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point back.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is two years ago in Greece <unk>
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who was attending a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if he wanted to give a very good party, they don't bring a <unk> to <unk> <unk>
He stood up, <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and it was as soon as the <unk> room was <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed everybody, but it shattered the bodies that are <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
And so they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes in his mind, I could see where she had sitting every single way.
He took the family of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What they <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions that by the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional space <unk>
If I told you that I was passionate about the first 10 words of history that I just told you about <unk> you are very likely to be able to do it.
But I would bet if you let them tell you who I was sitting on the horse <unk> brown in your <unk> you'd be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> images with things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> memory <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk, and you want to make it memory, in the same way that he would have done <unk> if they had invited him to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine getting into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Mister <unk>
And you remember that you want to introduce Ed friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that they want to tell.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth theme that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how speakers are <unk> <unk> their speakers, not word for word, which is going to mistake it is typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw this was just exciting, and I got stuck.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an <unk> event.
Really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets off the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered this was kind of fun.
I would never expect it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What it's really about doing is to make it better and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was quite hooked with this.
This is me, using my standard standard training team for memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and a pair of security covered with tape <unk> leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Now, it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just just <unk> tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to start building <unk> of memory or <unk> <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little insights about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory memory are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing -- a full kind of attention that most of it is not <unk> around there.
But the reality is that there's no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, it's what you <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what's already our short existence in <unk> or <unk> -- not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks around our side, we are going to be so <unk> that we don't even engage in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so you can just <unk> just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am of <unk> <unk> I was six years old and lived there at home of my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they all spend a while watching television TV, and so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me and every time I got it, and I would come back, and I would all come back on a <unk>
And I was like this.
It was <unk> <unk> and hated it.
I took that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and <unk> of <unk> but of those <unk> emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel that way, because according to Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little <unk> and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you care about -- you think of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it because we have a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that architects can create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art environment.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build houses.
Look, these <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the sea, removed from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people that <unk> <unk> and governments are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves in buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which was finished in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he has a <unk> has this round thing, columns, red, <unk> red, that <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the kids, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, I finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media in the digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and to share.
So, how is it possible in the same year, two buildings, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects who are constantly carrying new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms of life.
We were going to do it and we gave them so much, that we get away from the people.
All of the black -- this is <unk> you think we're very good, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We need to go to the other side and come back to those symbols with these symbols.
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to experiment with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> over and over and over and over and over again.
Well, 30 years ago I was <unk> from the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It's about concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Something really hard.
So we're approaching the 1980s, and we started to incorporate these symbols.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> in the other direction.
We take those forms that we know like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add bake and use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we made them in skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes would be won by boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
insane.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
These fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian <unk>
You may have a little bit of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making the pendulum swing back in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques, and we find them with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You're totally <unk>
Normally the pendulum <unk> back in the opposite direction.
But then something happened to happen.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical <unk> and public in general, were completely entirely entirely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> is building <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao increased by two and 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how it is possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media was <unk> around them and quickly learned that these shapes and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennials went with other architects star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through all the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Imagine, for example, how do they use architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next village to see a building.
The transport is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't really require a lot of time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings more, before knowing if which I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is what we found with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That's never going to be going to happen. <unk> because we're at the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to media media, starts swing faster and faster, until getting in both extremes almost <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you guys, the public.
We can now make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a town called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like the finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started getting and shared it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, because these are not just the images of a building, because these are not just the images of a building, it's the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes <unk> with collective memory, and in charge of these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first to <unk> the Internet looking for <unk> <unk>
We were bombarded with examples of innovation, about innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell them that there's no single answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that are using words and <unk> and complicated, and you're no longer a public audience that doesn't embrace anything that I haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave them from architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another one another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical <unk> historical <unk> based on ideas of what the <unk> has to be <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means the buildings <unk> to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also can serve for a sport or to <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream on the East <unk> East New York, and raising half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, is no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
No matter how we built, what matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for everyone to you.
And finally, we're no longer <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they give the spaces more <unk> local <unk> the homes where we form our children, and the <unk> step in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does this very cool way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is look at it in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do it. And I was thinking, When did you do this?
How do we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for <unk> "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it just wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday overnight.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though her mom tells her all the time he is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
And what his mom says to him and what her friends, or colleagues who say, "You don't know who to believe.
So he does a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and she says to others who please leave a <unk> "I'm a pretty <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has got more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve for thinking about them.
We talk about a normal healthy teenager, which gets these answers into one of the most vulnerable lives of their life most vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is the leading to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking <unk> giving you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never done.
Never before we have been so connected, so they were so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like there's a party in your fourth <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of reviews that they do.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what it is <unk>
What is the biggest thing in the life of someone who is normal in a every day?
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from news <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people compared to.
But kids aren't immune to this.
Like the superheroes of the sport, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a <unk> culture, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and effort and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical <unk> their studies and other ways they start to be hurt.
Six in 10 girls would rather do something because they think they're not really good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and how to taxpayers and to the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One in five are not going to be attending at all the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you see you good enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin, thin, <unk> a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And it figures out regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be clear, of course, we're talking about how you see you not how you really are.
<unk> over your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
adolescents with time, do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet not healthy that they can bring them to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this because of what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> surgery <unk> sexual <unk> and no protection and <unk> damage.
The search of the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have <unk> again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't have a job interview on a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see them.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is an interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, I don't take it too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first one is that we have to nurture trust in its own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of software available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow is not just a positive impact -- but also an <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas, the first one is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six ways are pivotal starting for anyone willing to provide a body of body education that works.
One education is fundamental but grapple with this problem requires each of us to take charge in the issue and be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
It is challenging the current status of the women, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the input, of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start judge people who are, not as you see them.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments that we published in our social networking networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and as businesses, to really change our culture, so that our kids will grow to valuing all of their children to assess the <unk> <unk>
We need to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
Let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them go out on the big screen, because we just will create a different world.
A world in which our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they are never going to look at the age of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
Her <unk> <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two <unk> -- what would it mean for her if it was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, which was <unk> by not having long legs -- <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we did this -- and we would say it takes its potential for this way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images are <unk> all of us.
But let our children the truth.
So I think the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
<unk> the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, they will become the humanitarian change agents of themselves in themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
The five of November 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and murdered the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
It was initially asleep, but being a prisoner for other young charges in the company of others, started to plan attacks on about 12 <unk> in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily those plans were <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center couldn't be <unk>
Later on, <unk> would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer who was <unk> with a loving mother, a teacher to elementary school teacher school teacher school teacher school teacher school <unk>
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which is very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to interact with, you don't need a lot to wish the same things in life.
However, in religion, in all of the human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think we need to use every possible means for everyone living as them.
A few months before the arrest was with me and explained that in the last weekends he and some friends, he had been going to rush training on Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched me, my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point out to the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet I shot I gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise all of us, especially of me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
All of us, the comment made a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they thought so funny.
You saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later they would be condemned to put a <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center causing an explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times. That instability during my childhood wasn't allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable with somebody that's already <unk> and going to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class with often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white But it will be the new of the <unk> silent and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> to grow under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> forced to people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences they put in trial to test my way of thinking about it was during the 2000 presidential elections.
In a <unk> program that I participated in the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my entire life, was something that I felt very much passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids that we had made <unk> was Jewish <unk>
I took several days out of light that detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to overcome the barrier that all life had made me believe was <unk>
Another crucial moment came out when I got a summer work work in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures -- that experience was critical in the development of my character.
Every life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a kid, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat similar people, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be <unk> but I know what is to be trial for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart got me <unk> honest about my <unk> and I was helping me to see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure that I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> it wasn't in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that <unk> in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the <unk> eyes from someone who's suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself into a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is going to try to take violence and can hear my story and understand that there is a better way. That even though I gave me to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it for the victims of terrorism and by their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has made up in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against those <unk> acts against the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or race, which children don't have to follow their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible film, incredible.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on the flow of conscious thinking.
The <unk> heart are you who experiences all directly.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, you and you and tea.
There's nothing to do more directly.
At least, I know I have an consciousness.
I don't know that you're aware of you.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to do to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
<unk> by nature, is objective <unk>
<unk> by nature, is subjective in nature.
So you can never have a science of consciousness.
Because for most of the 20th century, we would have that vision.
Psychology was studying <unk> behavior. The neuroscience is studying the <unk> brain, but never no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientists in consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment that science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints to the moment.
The center of consciousness in recent years was the search for <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of wonderful work I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or happy pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a rocket science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience is answering some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain are doing and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emergent behaviors, how do they operate <unk> how they work <unk> how <unk> are adapting and <unk> living organisms -- all of them are questions about how objective work.
That could apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we can talk to how we talk to them, how we play <unk> are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior is between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why all behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientist.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that I can work for a long time, to hit me on the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to stand at this point.
We have a wonderful chain of wonderful, great explanations -- the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this <unk>
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
We don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning, <unk> crazy ideas before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such problem difficult for consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective movie includes sort of an illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- and so they study everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be satisfying
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
So physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe like <unk> <unk> space and the mass.
We would make fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
Rather, they think of fundamental <unk> and there are the world constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> time, <unk> laws and <unk> laws of <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept than those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space <unk> time, <unk> then because of the question of logic, you have to add the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens up the path for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts space, space -- the <unk> physical processes.
physicists sometimes say we want to be fundamental laws so simple we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the <unk> even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when you think -- always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some element of <unk> feeling <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How did anyone think so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, the time and the mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws that <unk> the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there's information processing -- there's consciousness.
<unk> <unk> complex <unk> as a human <unk>
<unk> information -- simple <unk>
A very exciting thing is that in the recent years of a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which calls <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I'm supposed to <unk> it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration, it is quite significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, you particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is lower, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness of zero.
It actually <unk> a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
physicists and philosophers are often observed that the physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying it.
As this explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire coming from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be <unk> but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire at equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there at the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision, has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and very serious <unk>
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think we think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system from Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing -- so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, and you have a very serious ethical problems about the ethics of development of intelligent computers and the ethical ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the collective <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own.
Or a local level, an integrated group like the audience at a TED Talk, we now have a collective collective consciousness -- an internal film for this full of TED movies -- different from the internal movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
Actually, I'm sure the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second one, which is universal.
Vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love us.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve this overnight.
But I think we will finally see it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in rural Victoria.
I had a very normal, a very normal profile of education.
I went to school, I <unk> with my friends, I was <unk> with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a obvious.
She actually hasn't gotten anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low-cost profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I do. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement.
So years later, being in the second part of the teaching in a high school of <unk> as only after about 20 minutes in the class, 11 <unk> <unk> a guy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What is <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the <unk> law for some good minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people at the wheelchair, they talk about <unk> things in school?"
<unk> in the <unk> room.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experience with people with disability with disability and inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not the <unk> of the boy, that is, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire them.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair -- and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you lie to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is <unk> A capital <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something bad and can't make you remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You can be you've seen one, of the girl without the hands of a pen flowing through the mouth.
You may have seen a kid who runs with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And use porn porn as a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the <unk> of people with no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and say, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But if you are that person?
I've lost the count of the number of times that have been tackled to me, strange to express that you think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was kind of like me getting up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will <unk> people with disability with disability for people with no disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not as bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
We have some things.
But the things that we are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was given to the so-called social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more <unk> because of the society we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They simply are using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to <unk> in the way we do, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the <unk> because we have sold this lie that disability makes us remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Why are God, you're not just inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I'm in.
<unk> from other people with disability all the time.
However, I don't think I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> this is a cool idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to carry on the mobile phone in the battery of the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk> us.
I really think that that lie that they have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lies because it's not true -- because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of <unk> has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't be considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability to be <unk> to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement.
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see reality <unk> and professional football, with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think <unk> <unk> thinks about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and is going to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because reality augmented our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, it's what I've been wearing <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will relate to your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the field of game to 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man from 110 pounds of <unk> trying to <unk> it with all his being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's take some videos to show you what the Google <unk> is to use under the hull, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of <unk> technology is a submarine upward up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
Just a moment.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of <unk> from University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, to be their favorite players -- and I've been asked on YouTube and in <unk> "You can see from the angle of a <unk> field.
or <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which surely many of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to show you why by this video.
Man: Oh.
No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller coaster <unk> for his life.
What is the experience of a fan of a fan of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> which is the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball into the bottom of the network? or <unk> it by making a <unk> in <unk>
What is your experience when you get a mountain of a mountain over 100 miles an hour as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the gun soap <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when I <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a quick review on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> in Baltimore had a <unk> to his field <unk> so they would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed on the <unk> of the <unk> of the field, and then in the <unk>
They had <unk> because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player going back to your group, and you see your next step as shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have -- you don't have to worry about <unk> <unk>
Or by <unk> the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose <unk> and they hate to lose games.
If you lose <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You can also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that you're already working already.
And all that information gets you to your <unk>
The good teams will be <unk>
You will have the information <unk>
This brings the good teams of the bad teams.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis will stop being just for <unk>
It would be also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that they're the <unk>
Let's get the ball and <unk>
<unk> a <unk> suddenly, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- that a defense behind you is to <unk> you don't know, but the <unk> system will kill you.
<unk> the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have a open <unk>
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we land -- though, the receptor sees their bombsight an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> and the fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the party.
I'm going to do lots of people -- because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it as a bread and <unk> like our entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk> <unk>
It makes billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad actions are from perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay person in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is it worth <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science rather than <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, <unk> reality is coming.
The questions we do -- the decisions we take and the challenges we face and the challenges we face -- as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently found myself after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
The majority of those 23 years ago, I spent the southern end of the County <unk> which includes the Golden <unk> bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer who will build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped on their death from that bridge.
Some of them believe that traveling between the two towers going to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, such that each of them would leave you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used for committing suicide.
After a <unk> of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The <unk> impact bone, some of which would make vital organs.
Most people die in the impact.
The ones that no, they normally fall into the water and then <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will be aware of the death <unk> which is <unk>
This is the wire.
Except for the two towers, there are 32 inches of paper parallel to the bridge.
This is where most people have to take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on the edge, and at their darker time, it's very difficult to bring them back back.
I took this picture last year while this young woman spoke with an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who are killing the suicide, but to the officers as well.
We've come a long way from then.
Today, government officials and psychologists are trained to new <unk>
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on 22 <unk> last year by getting a call from a possible suicide <unk> sitting in the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an official of the Golden <unk> bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before the New Jersey to try and <unk> from this bridge.
After about an hour after an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the <unk> box.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created to <unk> and he sent them to the Earth with a box, and said, "You know, never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped some <unk> leaned on the right, and it left.
This kind of clever guy in New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how she was.
The parents of Jason had all order.
<unk> damage to suicide affects a lot of people.
I pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What <unk>
<unk> what by that?
In my experience, it's not just to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing you can do by <unk> social isolation, and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read you your letter.
She lost her son on January 19 of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he is with her permission and blessing who read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with her father the 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the police police and <unk> it as disappeared as they disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house, and they reported me that the <unk> car was down in the bridge.
I had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the evening of the day.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be too temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been wrong without having a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful harbor -- not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the path that his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of <unk> 2005, I replied to a radio call for a possible suicide bomber on the street <unk> near the north.
I <unk> my motorcycle on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, crossed immediately the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and the next half after, I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to go back to that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin <unk> <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made you <unk> and gave you the hope and your life <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the <unk> mother and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to give you a <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing <unk> the events on the 11 and you are one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it was correctly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I was only six months -- completely unconscious of all of those <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like the <unk>
So thank God for you.
I was a lot of debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote, <unk> When I went to the General <unk> General at San Francisco that night, you were <unk> like the patient.
I think I did have it <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and of his depression with the hope that its story inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found in the job.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> <unk>
That act, despite finishing his own pain, leaving me the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain.
Usually this is achieved by three things: you will sleep or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded to me and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and <unk> calls around the bridge.
And from those incidents that I've been directly involved with, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked to him about an hour.
During that time, I was <unk> my hand at three times.
On the end, he looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped on the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one who leaves the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every single one of us should be used to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world causes you to be what you don't are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question will tell you, How do you lie on that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone anyway.
When I became a model I felt that I finally had the dream I'd ever had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, which I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our religion, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the courage to get rid of the limitations of the skin color or the beliefs of us around us.
These are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent even, my story.
I think this enigma is <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this shirt on my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that shirt in <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair.
I knew then how to <unk>
<unk> has always been considered <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery <unk>
Because of my success, I never paid myself to share my story, not because I thought I will be what I'm going to be bad, but why the world deals with those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I can be a woman.
I have mom, dad and family who embrace me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these kinds of puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still <unk> I met this woman named <unk>
It's the head of a <unk> beauty competition.
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the lanes of <unk> and <unk> and that night, and that night, I won in the bathroom, she won in <unk> and she was a third <unk> between over 40 <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly I was inside the world of <unk> of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from queen of women <unk> but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they <unk> in remote <unk> in the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know, if you gave America to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I had two <unk> to my name.
She was also accompanied when I was <unk> in Thailand at 19 years.
It's funny that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand to do the most <unk> most sophisticated surgery and secure.
At that time, in the U.S., they need to be done before the name of the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving driver's license, and the <unk> of gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman, <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in her own truth, but she was able to end up his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that you live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the last 20 November, we make a global waking Day.
I'm on this scenario thanks to a long history of people that were <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, at this same moment, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue my truth to living my truth, and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
Would you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> Right. First of all, thank you with all my <unk>
My parents of support to my parents especially, my family, who is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been going to young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they were called, and they told me that their parents couldn't take it, and I would take my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, other no. It's just identity identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody gave us a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes that <unk> <unk> and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
<unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who know her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when he got her efforts in 2011, to <unk> the <unk> National <unk> <unk> became very popular in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you <unk> a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when I was born, a little girl, her birth would not <unk>
It's not welcome for his father, nor for her mother.
The neighborhood comes back, gives her <unk> to the mother, no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was <unk> a lot for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when she <unk> her third daughter, she feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only the suffering, but the daughter, <unk> daughter <unk> when they grow up as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, she stays at home and the school to her siblings.
Up until the age of 12 years, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes in adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, she is fed up with her home without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their home.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the name of his father and her brothers and her brothers and his family, and if you <unk> the code of that <unk> <unk> could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this <unk> code is not just affecting the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness in her sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a norm of the <unk> societies called <unk>
<unk> is supposed to be very <unk> humble and very <unk>
That's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embracing the decisions of their father and their mother and the choices, even if you don't want it.
If the <unk> with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with a old man has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to take it off.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives birth to more kids and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to her daughter and the same lesson for her children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when <unk> was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at her eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And a lot before I was <unk> I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> from <unk> and he called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she went on, when she was four and a half and a half and a half years old, I was <unk> it in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yes, I should <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in poor countries, in <unk> societies in tribal societies, is a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of her identity and his name.
One <unk> to school means that has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore its potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they took the form of a tourist <unk> and I was in the relative part to the family, couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I was never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried <unk> in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and girls in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students, I'll forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more room for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was a lethal rights for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all the economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls were banned from going to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and raised for the right to education.
He wrote a daily newspaper for the BBC, <unk> he was offered herself to the documentaries of the New York Times, and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and read nine in October 2012, they hit <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and to me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would hold her to the ear of my wife -- "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please do not <unk>
<unk> the right cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe pains, and strong headaches because his facial <unk> was down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I am well with my smile <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to be good enough. Please don't <unk>
It was a solace for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her to resist the hardest moments, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any age of 16.
<unk> when he doesn't just work.
They fight her brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special in my <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> as brave and expressive and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
He didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google <unk> group, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk>
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get into a brain operation.
You're still just as smart or not?
It's not like that, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to make, over a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, she would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix out of chemicals, and try to <unk> them to keep alive.
More than I have been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that we would be able to get the <unk> dose, because there is really no clear map that I would say in <unk>
I began to try and mix different <unk> and I was amazed by looking at how small changes in the <unk> doses of my <unk> my sense of who I was, my sense of who I am, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case, for a few months, I made a typical dose and typical chemical <unk> for a man of the 1900s, and I was amazed by looking at how to <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  of course, in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> fixing a problem I had in the front, and it just doesn't happen like that.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and what they have to do, since then I carry my best to men.
What I was trying to do is to <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking -- my creative flow of ideas.
It was going to think of always in images, and that became my key point of key reference, how do you have those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were to <unk> it <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes can see things like this.
They thought the images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the minds works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental for thinking <unk> and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I've got lots of great mental <unk> it really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images from my mind to the screen screen screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use his imagination only to drive the world that has the way?
Or if a musician could get the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
They both used technology -- it involves functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain that looks at an image.
The spinal cord shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as <unk> looking at that same image.
The column on the right was <unk> the contents of the central column on the left, you see that the difference is <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images with lots of different images in the same time.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields.
Let's go this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while <unk> their brains to create a large pool of reactions from the brain to the video sequence.
And then I showed you a film with new images -- new people, new animals, and as long as they <unk> a new <unk>
The computer -- using only brain information on the scan of it, to show what seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're good about it.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you can imagine that same image, you believed in the brain the same <unk>
It took place with the <unk> brain scanning systems available today, and its resolution to a thousand times as a thousand times in the last few years.
We now need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There are lots of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer me for that.
Many are proposing of new projection techniques by images, even <unk> <unk> with the recent <unk> of MRI -- first we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with larger magnets -- but to this point, <unk> magnets only provide small improvements in the resolution -- not gains for thousands like we need.
I propose this idea: rather than bigger magnets -- make better magnets.
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different <unk> like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a huge amount of effort on MRI were to make really cool magnets -- right?
And yet, most of the recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions, and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> scores on computer systems.
At its time, instead of a magnetic field they do, which is <unk> magnetic magnetic patterns -- <unk> to radio frequencies <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with patterns of radio processing processing we can increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use <unk> we should be able to measure not just blood fluid -- but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even the direct neural activity.
Will we be able to put our ideas in direct the digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> used as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure for Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have few options going to open up this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about leaving the closet, and not just the traditional sense, not just the gay man.
I think we all have <unk>
His <unk> probably is to tell you a person for the first time your loves or telling someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to get through in life.
And all of this is a difficult conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet to be a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I worked in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my armpits, <unk> the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be <unk> by the <unk> of my <unk> and I had <unk> my head <unk> I would ask me, usually a kid said, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there'd be awkward silence at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold, look at her son.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> in the inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a boy between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to get out of the <unk> issues at the table.  He had the <unk> of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a clip of the "Vagina Monologues," of the <unk>
So I took a <unk> and I went down the look and my backs a girl for four years with a <unk> <unk> looking at me, which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: Are you a girl or <unk>
So I took a lot of a <unk> again, I got out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is a bit wrong.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw <unk> but I'm a girl, and you know, I like to use a <unk> <unk> and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
I am more like the girl from a ninja pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and she has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> <unk>
And that was the whole thing. <unk>
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know what a feels like it feels in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or to yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons why I get out of my closet it was harder than getting out of your life, but this is the <unk> it's hard not to <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared online <unk> it's harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you that this story that I tell you is harder than telling you your five-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to be difficult for the other person to make us feel better or worse relative to our <unk> and we should just feel empathy because we all live in something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls are made of your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
But I, that had a horse, a horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
I was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child <unk>
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> my gay <unk> and moving only a muscle is the hardest thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers I've spent my entire life trying to <unk> and now the world was turned around on purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my most memorable <unk> <unk> was in my sister.
It was the first time a lot of the guests knew that I was gay, and by making my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people that I knew I did years ago.
And after talking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it is <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what's your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but wait for a desperately to show her support, to make me know that he was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to do.
It's just like the hard conversations are still <unk>
Ask anybody that I have ever met.
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves getting out of any reason is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they are gay, <unk>
If they say their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
They would never get upset about that.
And some of them can be wounded <unk> so they have done, but I'm never upset about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very yourself, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence, an example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to <unk> computing like Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I <unk> a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a walk.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept of intelligence on Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain point in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of an <unk> planet stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will boost the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in industrial <unk> planning, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them for several years ago: There is an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a force, <unk> that acts with the end of maximizing future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices with a force to you, with the diversity of potential future accessible, Yeah, to an impending time, to <unk>
In short, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
Science is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the open.
And so, according to this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that make more disorder, or <unk> for their life should be tendency to be more favorable conditions for existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection is <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior isn't only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually emerges directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> which is designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system where you can find inside.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple animal tests, play games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of it without the fact that they had to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing without <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave ourselves a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for humanoid robotics and human care.
This uses of tools will have applications in manufacturing manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing away from extremes of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable at a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see the successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see it to be able to make new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> constantly and keeps successful the network right now.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care and energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the pathways of a fleet of ships, discovering successfully and using the Panama Panama <unk> to expand globally from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems of defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see that we can spontaneously find out and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated <unk> negotiation in a simulated <unk> <unk> increasing assets under exponentially.
This risk of risk will have vast applications in finance, secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of false human markings are intelligent such as the use of tools, and walking upright and social cooperation, all flow from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
So back to the first use of the term robot, <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there'd be a <unk> rebellion, there would be <unk>
<unk> <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion, <unk> in reverse.
It's not that the machines first get smart and then <unk> and try to take it over the world.
It's all the opposite.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, "How do you look for targets you learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial artificial intelligence, is the following: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits into the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points that Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the faint <unk> of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they blocking a little bit of that light to go.
And the data gathered by the Kepler show the size of the planets besides the distance that there is between them and their mother.
And together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth Earth of our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their suns.
At turn, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, are now being in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've been through on a global scale have moved through our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a weather scientist or the weather, not <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the only planet and the planets that we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little farther from the Sun, it can be a potentially livable world that is shown to a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly that we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> are tracking their surface looking for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> as the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> <unk> of living on Mars.
But even though all these images are <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places, compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> <unk> and highest places on Earth is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm for the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag up with a great and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some of the Mars waiting to be able to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is really <unk>
For a lot that I like <unk> exploration, I disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is as a imagine that the captain of the Titanic will comment on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for exploration exploration, and the land preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of <unk> preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's only closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep spaces in the areas and the <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can actually meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with a <unk> experiment, the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi said, considering that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life life so far.
Well, where are you?
Well, a possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to be living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that we prescribe this development.
It's arrogant to think that only the colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but natural <unk> and <unk> exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the more easy task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I <unk> my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see by the window that were at the table in the dining table where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows and all of them were okay.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and I was exposing my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure that they are not more expensive than a half night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, it was very stuck.
I am a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain is under stress.
<unk> <unk> that the heart rate increases, you know, <unk> levels and <unk> the thinking.
And when I arrived at the counter of <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to wonder, if there was something I could do, the systems that I could put in their place, which was going to take some bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, you will give you the likelihood that it is a total catastrophe there.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts would not happen.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> the Nobel <unk> and a little embarrassed he told him about I broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared he had been practicing with me that I had been practicing <unk> retrospective <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a party team comes in, and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that might go wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so apparent.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
And in the house, you take a place for things that are easily <unk>
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science supporting this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the good things are, where the fish are, where the fish are, where the tribes are <unk> and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that's <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find your nuts.
And if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too good for things that move too well.
This is the reason for losing the car keys, reading <unk>
So at home, you get a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
To your passport, it's a particular drawer for you.
For your reading, a particular <unk> in particular.
If you take a place and are <unk> with it, your stuff will always be there when you <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards -- stop driving your email to yourself, so you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases your brain.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress won't be at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved self to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the decision-making decisions -- and in fact to cause financial decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that we need to take from that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the physician says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of infectious diseases attack the heart <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the physician says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, and you may even know that you know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question you should do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most doctors don't want to talk about, and companies companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not a fault of the doctor, and if it's fault somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs are just 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to deal with most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before to help a person?
300.
This is the research research researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I do explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or a brain event.
Now maybe they think, "Well, one probability in 300 to lower my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everyone <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> things <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but they are now thinking, <unk> percent is not very likely to happen to me, still to take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember under stress you don't think clearly.
So think of how we <unk> this over time, so you don't have to build the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 -- have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that helps you the drug.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say that you have to have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the principle of informed consent <unk>
We have right to have access to this kind of information to initiate the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in air by the value of the crash, but actually this number you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men from 50, <unk> prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
This is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you get lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make that <unk> the conversation forward.
You don't have to do all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life <unk> or a longer life that could have much pain in the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change it in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face the face of a <unk> you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, it doesn't react fast. You might be <unk>
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those times of stress is the logical thought, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at the time.
The idea is to think about the future of how you might be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help us minimize damage, or to prevent things that bad things happened in the first place.
<unk> at the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor to installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the front door, with a key way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I don't ordered and lots of mail that I haven't read about.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can I be -- never <unk> a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the story of the American system of sign -- the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French language language came during the 1970s and the step of the time, it mixed with the local pages, and developed the language that we know today.
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And they taught me to believe that the sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a <unk> world is like I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and rules without <unk>
So how do I understand the <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the plastic bag.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure they didn't get <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
I might think of the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the sign of <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to make my thumb and not feel natural.
That's why I had four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic school there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to be more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not only experienced through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or I can experience it visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim ownership and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything they had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and <unk>
I realized that sound is like money, power, the social currency <unk>
In the back of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that I could go back to me and my artistic work, or I could tell me.
I chose I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support the same just like and become my voice.
I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work, and institutions work with many different performers from <unk>
And their voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could focus on the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new art, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and the <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capture and express fully in the paper.
And the same can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning of the signals as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a piece of the piano, so you can understand how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in lots of different <unk>
If you <unk> a different <unk> for every finger while the piano touches the piano, as the facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and the speed, the way the <unk> is a linear language, as if it's <unk> only one key at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers to express a concept or a sense of <unk>
If only a key would change the chord, would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in the tone, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> on that."
This is the <unk> sign on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and <unk> it over and again, it might be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign -- the sun comes out and <unk>
This is "All the day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can be said of <unk> <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This is how time is expressed in <unk> and how far the distance to the body can express changes over time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Look at the right hand right now, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk>
You can do it with me?
All of your hands up.
Now we're going to do it both in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yes, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, a third. Please try it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in the head and the chest. But they make a very different substance.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> has no sound sound, it doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what social value defines and allow the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> You don't have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a treasure trove of trove of trove of <unk>
I'd like to encourage you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a perceptual bubble or a bubble of ignorance -- I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning the other from others.
Time is now an adult and I teach citizen and invention in <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these large ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also too risky to use these enormous <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dreamed of making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work <unk> so that children very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel great and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it to the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I'll leave you to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try and take the best ideas of every child and try to figure it into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids are connected to the robots.
Then we started very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we turned out light and <unk> cameras and put it into a floating robot that is slowly moving through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor, while the computer on board will process this picture and measure the size of every <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention step into a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
And I was looking at my problem <unk> But my students in Hong Kong are very enlightened kids.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and they <unk> with this one.
One child, maybe under 10 years old, cleaning a oil spill, just using the oil spill, the world's largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the water where they <unk> the place where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown -- the mud and the oil are also brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what is in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor, and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
And I was looking at a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroyed several cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear center close to water.
And today, according to the average reports of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean traces up <unk> pollution by <unk>
If we go on the west coast, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has a piece of blue. It's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year since the accident and researching independent with other scientists, the land, the river, and we wanted to take the kids.
Of course we didn't have the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we go to the center of <unk> here is the use of <unk>
It might seem that they didn't take work seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> their whole life.
Together with them we discussed data that day and talk about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigmented data to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust would be <unk> from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil expedition the closest close to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a 1.5 miles of the nuclear <unk> and with the fishermen help of the area we were collecting the <unk> of the sea floor with a <unk> <unk> as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's becoming more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the harm we've done.
We haven't even begun trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so much so much, we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we become the largest space dedicated to environmental and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry -- a little bit of biology, of optical fibers, you can build almost from everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the children of children can actually become reality with the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of age transforming their <unk> chairs in new <unk> vehicles.
<unk> oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We cannot afford the children of the horrible truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, scientists, scientists, <unk> we need to prepare the next generation for the environment and the people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes of <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of one silk silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One imposes on the environment, the other one I believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one by it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we bring all the information to take it for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think about their objects as <unk> of different kinds of functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
One is acting mainly as filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that gradually <unk> its functionality through <unk> variation.
Here's a divided screen that represents my worldview.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere.
My job at its simplest level, tries to bring these two views of the world, moving away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why was it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where you have four disciplines that give designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and my students' hands.
We designed objects, products, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a <unk> base that somehow not to print buildings to <unk> buildings that are not far far to print buildings that glow in the darkness.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where each aperture is only only to model the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion fashion fashion <unk> <unk> <unk> It's like a second made of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with <unk> 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and 3D <unk> with no seams between the cells.
This a stiff helmet and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> <unk>
That designers have access to this high-resolution behavior and <unk> instruments allow them to design products that are <unk> not only the form of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the same structural and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher my collaborator went back to nature to <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
It is the surface, like in nature, its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but continuously continuously and <unk> the material itself.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck and came to define a lot of what really matters.
Like she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> <unk>
For that first tree -- there was no difference between trunk, including leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made the trees with twigs, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world done everywhere.
I often ask, "What would the design be if the objects were made from a single piece?
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we're looking for the material to get the kind of material on the tree with fruit and and we found it.
The most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons that are produced every year by organisms as shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So we think that if we could tune in to the tune of their properties, we could generate structures that were <unk> in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We were asking a lot of <unk> of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of material about the march and create these structures made of one material 3.5 century long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves them to find a natural shape to the eye with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria engineered bacteria to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it on sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> <unk> and if it grows even more, <unk>
A <unk> tree.
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure that is made of shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best <unk> for objects designed to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> life and put it on the ground, help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration of the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master the bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new basic <unk> into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second <unk> <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One converts light into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
So to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that resembles the tract tract -- that will help you <unk> these bacteria and make their function on the way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material that are <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> to <unk> more transparent.
This bionic system <unk> when it reaches from one end to another side, it goes down 200 feet.
This is half the length of a football room, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design would make the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the alive?
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the damage and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer does it prints material material.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which is <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through combining not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, <unk> those fibers together.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first turn into the environment, creates a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process, attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm.
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture from the cocoon of silk.
However, when we put out the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different parts -- and we've discovered that the shape -- the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
<unk> <unk> worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape the raw silk silk one <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms to the most dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat -- distributing silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get <unk>
We wanted to make silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk on silk <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion, their integrity.
And in little about two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk has a robotic arm, the other full of empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
This is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to a common nature of design, which demands us for the first time that we can take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you ever asked you, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they asked them for the first time, they were asked by the first time.
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In the school I liked the English English, the <unk> and the art and the websites and the websites -- she would play the guitar in an punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And usually I like to test and persist anyway, having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of <unk> this sense of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I was given to something else, something completely different, and I got stuck in it, and I let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this stuff into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions, and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that made me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or being densities, or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to ask me to put up then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you can <unk> it to the <unk>
You ask ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody matters what they would do at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in the kids, like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is going over and over again as we grow in various ways, you know, <unk> high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before what you take away from sleep.
Why?
As well as this issue, inspire children to dream of what they might be, is not inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, just the contrary, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are OK -- and say, "Oh, what nice, but you can't be a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the very <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and to devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are lots of different themes that show your curiosity and a lot of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in the framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feel like there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with lots of interest and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help you divide in three and multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms.
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of <unk> to a community, we can't agree with an identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or woe you have to win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
There are three superpowers that are <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
That is, the combination of two or more fields, and creating something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests as well as a data visualization, and I travel math and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates <unk> <unk>
At <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for her <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at intersections.
So the new ideas.
And <unk> with all of their background, they can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is the rapid learning.
When we <unk> you in something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to <unk> as a lot of times in the past, and this means we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort zones.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk>
As a girl pianist <unk> an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he turned into a writer, she was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales mechanics when it was starting their thumb, and this skill helps to write compelling <unk> for editors.
<unk> is rarely a loss of time to get to what you can tell you even if you finally get it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform it into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, other <unk> books, sometimes a <unk> a <unk> sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> journal defines adaptability as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes as quickly and <unk> that are individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the needs of the market, which is really <unk>
<unk> of ideas and quickly learning, three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're pushed to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist, and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive dive and put ideas in ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are connected to how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them are told that they're just more like their fellow <unk>
And once said that, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring is whatever it is.
If you're a heart attack, then you go through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep in curiosity for those <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads to a more authentic life and happy.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman named <unk> they took her to a psychiatric psychiatric condition.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, and unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After her death, he <unk> a <unk> and found strange plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain, of a guy who had never seen before.
And even more amazing, even more amazing, even more shocking, even more shocking, even more shocking, even more surprising, the most shocking,
If you could have been living today, we couldn't give her more aid than she <unk> it <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
You have antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> lots of treatments for the <unk> <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's kind of progress on Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, it's going to affect 150 million that by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live to 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of two of them.
In other words, there is the probability that it is going to be <unk> with Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or be dear to Alzheimer's disease.
It's only in America, Alzheimer's <unk> costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs of <unk> increase in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> the boom.
I may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively <unk> to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research than in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but the whole world, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all of all, the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But only to look at a picture of someone who is aged healthy compared to the Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe memory loss of memory and mental abilities, the damage to brain caused by Alzheimer's life expectancy is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and weird <unk> in the <unk> brain, a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> dots end inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are <unk>
This makes the molecules of protein <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what happened to block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step to the right step of it, and then create a drug that do it.
Until recently, most of them have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. So now we're testing a new kind of drugs that we deliberately deliberately capture this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our recent results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when you test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick in each other inside of them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, of overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we manage it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure.
That was essential to progress on HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the <unk> victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimers disease isn't in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that needs to themselves.
<unk> talking to them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York Times column, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to try to test it one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will be <unk> to be 36 more personal questions, and then you look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions for example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you beat another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> your partner and what you like from him or her to her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that don't have you ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a really detail really called me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but, of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had the occasion to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we were <unk> and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the text column, I have a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably wondering: they stay in still still yet.
And the reason I think it's challenging this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was published the paper was very nervous.
I'd been working in a romantic book in the last few years, so I had taught me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can get to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually only of my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would reach a few thousands of view.
And that has a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and already the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, they'd already call me <unk> Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million <unk> and I was like, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with <unk> <unk> about <unk> experiences, but another thing is that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question first, they still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for the mailbox in my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared right away.
They were students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
But even I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the response.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both made a public rise together.
<unk> interviews of television interviews, and <unk> the requests for us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming a fear of becoming the <unk> <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if I was able to produce love love, not just an adventure, but love love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answer.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, especially the wrong question.
How do you know if you were to <unk> it or not, and then you get <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 little questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in it in 1997. And there the researcher goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, he was looking for <unk> <unk> among college students, using what I <unk> called <unk> staff and <unk> and <unk>
Sounds <unk> right?
But the study worked.
The participants felt more close to do so. Several later studies, also used protocol as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used between police members and community and community. And they have been used by the people of the political policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk on a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say you get rid of the person with whom you want.
Well he made a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better after proving the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was all my adulthood, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I took to science.
I did all I find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the point I thought I just did this for the book that I was writing for, in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I cling to the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I used to feel so bad at me.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one or a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably reasonably than reasonably <unk>
What I'm looking for love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> depending on the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people wondered when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than one question, we would think we make more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who your love deserves your love and who not?
How to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a well-known and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we get rid of us, and I'm very <unk>
But in love it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my paper. The love didn't happen.
<unk> <unk> because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about reading it now, not because it's true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything I was supposed to <unk>
It wasn't <unk> we would have both to make that decision, and as much as I have to keep doing that choice without knowing before if he would always choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and said, 36 questions, I'd chosen to love someone as generous, and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest U.S. newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really think of.
And what we <unk> and what might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my piece, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually written.
But what I have in change is the chance to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lesbian at the mountain and in a certain way I became like a <unk> forest.
The city of New York does a time ago.  Something that really affected me but more detail later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
He took a box of wood, and <unk> a bill of a dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment since I was in <unk> <unk> like to go of <unk> and <unk> and all of those things, and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took him all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the <unk> of resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resins on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite happened in a way it seemed to grow up as size, as if it was that I would <unk> text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, and these strange bottles that I was finding out the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things my whole life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow it up, drawing the same as you do about a body in the scene.
And I pulled the objects up, and I started my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I made insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human shape, sculptures of natural <unk> with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I no longer knew what to do, because the resin was going to kill you.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass layers, similar to drawing on a window on a window, and then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that form a three-dimensional <unk>
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired as big as <unk> garden <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
<unk> meters long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, there is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with animals are heading into <unk> lists for suicide <unk> <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god of bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform -- the <unk> <unk> for Osama bin Laden, there are all sorts of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
And anyway, also sort of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is going to be clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird's <unk> and it spits out clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> which joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn into the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened that.
Things that make up you know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball <unk> made of artificial cards in 1986.
You've been <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were to be baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through means and material and material is <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a form of human archive and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, <unk>
And you can walk in each other. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, you can get the <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, you have a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This is two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and enter the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the cavity <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're on a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a <unk> a <unk> a museum, a museum, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We <unk> the box and all the people in it strikes with each other as particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you get older, who is and the box in which you live.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of religion, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same stuff and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
It's going to take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug is <unk> in the body.
The <unk> though, is that <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When they take drugs that they do to decrease the amount of virus in the blood, and will increase the count of cells.
But they're also known by their side effects that are <unk> in their own negative, because in the time it takes to get to the blood <unk> it <unk> and worse still for the time that they take to your destiny, which is where it's most important, in the HIV.
These are regions of the body as the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the bloodstream, of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a life treatment for an oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> doing the treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the wounds and hip surgery and diabetes surgery can be used for anything else -- including drug <unk> of medicines.
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open up or drill extremely small holes that open and close and close to almost immediately cells with HIV to introduce medicines.
The best people ask, "What is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful ray of laser membrane on the mobile membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drugs.
The laser cuts through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug for a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology or <unk> but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk>
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll get a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, go to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researchers in our case, a laser treatment with laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, <unk> or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these generators and study ways of encouraging violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to nonviolent <unk>
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors and actors here.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, and <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
Since their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Likewise, the Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just to fire.
They're multitasking creatures.
<unk> a complex machine, of <unk> radio stations, TV TV channels and strategies in social networks.
And here's the <unk> magazine magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising complex but through business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They're building schools, running hospitals, put in professional training and <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in an Afghanistan torn out of the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price for the population.
But in general, to provide social services it means to fill an empty gap -- a <unk> gap by the government, and lets these groups strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social job of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid in.
<unk> because they fill gaps <unk> by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups are involved in the violent struggle and they give governance.
And the more sophisticated and the sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can less <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
So <unk> part of a landscape, run all its functions. They collect the trash system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, <unk> nations and hybrids and the weaker ones are the states, like in the <unk> Middle East -- and they fill that gap Soviet actors not government.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in not military tools.
<unk> that state of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we understand better <unk> we understand better what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors don't <unk> military power can win some fights, but not to make peace or stability.
In order to achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill out that <unk> to fill that governance governance that allowed these groups will thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I am a <unk> failure.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid that accepting openly the label tag openly -- it would be <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I was amazed by a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you one step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> sex.
Today, I see how they're treated women around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a <unk> and nasty.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking high self-worth and dare to believe it's equal or higher to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until he realizes that it's actually that woman and cannot imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same money for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we <unk> free <unk> or violence.
We have right to use it in a easy way and accessible to control and <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines to <unk>
We have the <unk>
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to have our other <unk>
We are not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and our social condition and skills and much more.
We need to have these differences and how we think about the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive the job, I hear rap music to all volume.
Even though the letter degrades women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> from the Yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical values.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> maintenance in <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and the nice stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy tales that they do.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides he decides to stay home to raise her children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
Let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women -- the gay and gay workers, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and high class.
Listen, if that's a good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist feminist here.
It also happens the following: As <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we will make perfection.
When we <unk> <unk> very comfortable from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself <unk> of that <unk> before I try to wear there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> by fear that it means that they're not able to do with the little bit of realistic.
Let's take a <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk>
It was a <unk> show, watching this star star openly to do openly feminism and do that to the women and young men that will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless debates if it was not a feminist <unk>
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
<unk> perfection from <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We go much beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the <unk> feminism -- until it's not left.
We don't need to do that.
Now, a <unk> Feminism is a more inclusive <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from to recognize our <unk> to give the action and being a little bit <unk>
If I listen to music -- I'm going to create a demand for artists that would be happier to be providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until <unk> change actually affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad choices are justify that it makes it harder for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three-year-old and four years.
These are two <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
They are <unk> by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk> of <unk>
We can change radio station when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't deal with women as well as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in their magazine, participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't include enough enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your book or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also <unk> ourselves to being including as much as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to decision jobs.
Since we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without needing to adopt these <unk> are going to mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions are coming to the top, to people in the power directors, and producers of film and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also say with courage -- good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a <unk> feminist <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say that, most of all, because <unk> my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to cope with what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was nothing.
I started to believe it was nothing.
I <unk> my voice, and after all I didn't get bothered by believing I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I <unk> myself in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked at me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you got brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what we can measure.
This is through writing and <unk> I also discovered that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see that none of us is anything that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I tell the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little courageous, when you need such a little bit of <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be fatal for a child with an immune immune system -- is one of the diseases rather <unk> in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be still <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that sparked the argument about autism and vaccines and <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe the majority of intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines are in danger to their children of autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism over time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very bizarre disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians that I had heard of her and talk to the whole professional life without seeing one single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates followed by only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
With fundraising companies like <unk> <unk> are routinely referred to autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people at the Centers for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic -- and a better <unk> detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for in the face of her son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be asked by what they were so reduced in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the full power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist that I read <unk> at Johns <unk> <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked <unk> the private patients who seemed <unk> private worlds, <unk> people around their own parents.
You could have fun for hours by shaking their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey from panic to <unk> as when they didn't put his favorite toy in their usual way without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 cases of his syndrome as it <unk> references as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the <unk> criteria for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis for <unk> but now we know that <unk> is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had turned nine in every 10 children sent by other doctors to their doctor's office, without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was an intelligent man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of childhood <unk> caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, have kept carefully in a fridge <unk>
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that you put together in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When her mother put one of his favorite records and he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like children were just <unk> what they had heard their parents <unk> dying to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own fine, turning into invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started testing the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> scientific, cognitive psychologist. I thought the theory of mothers who were <unk> from <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed <unk> without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National <unk> Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was <unk> in London called <unk> to try and find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw clearly that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse reality.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit on beautiful <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How did nobody realize these children before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article that was published in German <unk> the next year, the <unk> article, and then <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this item of competition, but avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was <unk> and he was <unk> for her.
The paper offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a <unk> clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music classes with music, and kids follow their <unk> on <unk>
Instead of blaming parents of causing autism, <unk> described as <unk> disability for life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces over the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, <unk> who called them their little teachers, and started to help in the development of education that were especially suited to them.
<unk> <unk> saw autism as a diverse diverse diverse that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they always have been, looking at aspects of this continuous <unk> known in pop culture as awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, just a grain of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad and <unk> model.
These changes didn't go into broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked out there to reform these people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before I came out -- <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and parents of everybody knew what autism.
At the same time, the first easy clinical trials were introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I no longer had to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> the same as predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were expected to be out of it, and that the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the increase -- a powerful and powerful history of credible and <unk> like <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right -- the autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve by the new breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and suffers from a attention to the details.
<unk> autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that believed that the <unk> for most autism aspects are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, communities, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we <unk> towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
